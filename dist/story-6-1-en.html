              For the most part my creature kept others away. But visitors still
              came sometimes. There were nights when I woke up in the middle
              state between dreaming and being awake, and saw faces in the wall,
              staring at me. Once I woke up with a heavy feeling in my chest. I
              lifted a blanket and a face was looking at me, lying on my body.
              Another time, there was a wild animal screaming in the corridor.
              It was a pretty intense and scary time.
            </p>
            <p>
              My psychiatrist friend turned into my boyfriend, and it was my
              first long term relationship. I cared about his feelings and
              trusted him a lot. He stopped me twice from committing suicide.
              First time I was around 18. It was an evening of early spring.
              Snow was still outside, but rivers already opened up. I made my
              mind to jump into a river from a bridge on the other end of the
              city. I got dressed, took my stuffed bear and left the room.
              Kirill caught me at the corner of my apartment building. He felt
              something wrong and came just on time. I tried hard to get rid of
              him, but he did not let me go. Finally, I told him that I’m done,
              and I’m going to stop this misery. He said that he is going with
              me. I could not objectively say how serious I was, but the idea of
              coursing someone’s death was unacceptable for me. So we went home.
              And he stayed by my side for two years. He left me, when I was in
              a 2-week visit to Germany from the University. I was shocked from
              such news. And met him at a club after sometime. We talked, and he
              said that everything nice and warm that he had for me is dead now
              and nothing left. It was unbearable for me. He was my tiny little
              stick I could hold on to have any sense to live. The one and only
              support was gone. Life turned to a totally dark, cold, lonely
              place again. The mind created the second decision to stop this
              misery. I said goodbye to Kirill, ordered a taxi and stood at the
              door of a club having a cigarette. I saw a knife and my kitchen,
              opened door of the flat. It was raining. Kirill felt me again. The
              taxi was not coming, so he caught me at the door and pulled me
              back to the club. We talked till the morning and that helped me.
              The mind changed. We were in a short contact for three years as he
              owed me money. We were renting a flat for a super low price, and
              he was supposed to collect that money, and he did not. So when one
              day I got a call to send the money to the landlord I called
              Kirill. I asked for the money, and he said he had none. That was a
              great time to learn who my real friends were. At that moment I had
              to send 24000 rubbles, which is around 320 USD. I was earning 8000
              rubbles, which is $108, for my month living and my mom sent me
              5000 = $67 to pay for the flat. As you see it was insane to get
              this money at once. I had 3 days to find them. People who I
              thought were my friends told me to call my mother. I have never
              asked her for help or money. At that moment I was studying at
              psychological faculty in the evenings, so my classmates were
              adults who worked. So I asked 2 people from a group and my
              friend’s lover. These 3 people borrowed me money. I was paying
              that debt for a year and a bit. It was hard to pull even a
              thousand from my tiny salary. Those people helped me because they
              trusted me as a responsible individual. That touched me a lot.
              Those people did not really know me, but they trusted and helped.
            </p>
            <p>
              I did not want to ask my mother for money because I rarely asked
              her for anything. I can remember few moments when I did ask for
              something.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I turned 13 my body changed a lot. I got big boobs pretty
              fast and gained weight. There was no explanation about what is
              going on with my body. I got ashamed of boobs and had no bras to
              cover myself and most of my clothes got small. I borrowed some
              sweaters from my mother’s wardrobe, and learned about bras from my
              friend. That year my friends/boys turned into hungry wolves,
              staring at my boobs and wide hips. It felt like my own body
              betrayed me. Everything was so thin and comfortable before and
              then suddenly turned into strange huge everything. That winter I
              was wearing my mother’s old-fashioned boots. They were so ugly and
              did not match anything that everyday I felt totally ashamed and
              confused. I did not say anything. I was just going through that
              misery every day. One evening my elder brother came to mom’s
              house. He was already living on his own and working. But he came
              in nice jeans and jacket and asked mom to give him money for a new
              pair of pans. And mother just pulled it from the wallet and gave.
              I was so jealous that I started crying like crazy and yelling that
              she buys so easily anything he wants, and I have to go through
              this shame everyday wearing her clothes and shoes. After that we
              went to some shops and bought me some clothes, bras and boots.
            </p>
            <p>
              During the university period I never asked my mother for money.
              She sent a certain amount every month and this was it. I was doing
              my best to survive and spend it carefully. But quite often at the
              end of the month I had to walk home after the university. Because
              there was not enough money for a street car. So I used the
              leftover money for a morning ride cause the walk took 2 hours or
              so. I had some cheap pastries for breakfast, ate something at the
              university and had dinner at my aunt’s place. That dinner was
              always a saviour, because sometimes I was out of money for food in
              the university, so I skipped the lunch. It was hard to figure out
              how to spend the money properly. I was having fun for the first
              part of the month and then could hardly make it to the end of the
              month.
            </p>
            <p>
              After I started my psychological education studying at the
              languages faculty turned easier. I started to ask questions when
              the teachers tried to give me a satisfactory mark. The faculty of
              translation means that you deal with the dictionaries a lot, and
              you chose certain words among a line of others with the same
              meaning. So when a teacher checked and judged the quality of my
              translation I asked questions: “Why my translation is worse than
              someone who gets a better mark? Why their choice of words is
              better and more correct?” That was as funny as sad. None of the
              teacher could explain, so their answer became: “will you be
              satisfied with a good mark?” I answered “yes”. Done. After some
              time they just started to give me good marks.
            </p>
            <p>
              For 5 years of translation faculty I met 4 nice teaches. One was
              an interesting old man. He liked me and we had nice discussions
              sometimes. His subject was about culture. He organized the exam
              the way that only one person entered the room. When I entered it
              he asked: “so what’s your plans for this winter holidays?”. I was
              going to visit my mother on the island. So he replied: “Nice! I
              will not hold you then. Take a good rest!” And gave me an offset.
              That felt so cool. He was on my side. The second teacher was a
              super strict tiny lady. She taught us the German language. She did
              not like me at first, because I shaved my head at that time and
              that was quite unusual. So, she asked me to wear a hat at her
              classes. I did so and I won her heart with my strong knowledge of
              German language which I got from my brilliant teacher at school.
              She gave me an excellent mark at the final exam even when I made a
              mistake. The third was a nice teacher of Latin language. We built
              a team to participate in the university humorous competition. We
              were going to play for our faculty. And she was responsible for
              this type of activity, so the deal was: if we take first or second
              place, we all get offset. We got second place. We could not get
              the first because the lawyer faculty was drinking with the judges.
              And the last one was a petite sweet lady for French classes. It
              was free, so I thought I can take it. But after a few tries I
              realized I did not really have time for that. So I gave up.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was attending all the classes and very often made the class go
              crazy. The translation is a very funny thing. For example on
              simultaneous translation class you have to say something even if
              you understood nothing from a dictated sentence, so those who did
              not understand were boggling around all the time. And I was
              laughing really loud all the time and this made everyone laugh.
              The teaches asked me to leave the room to stop this laughter, but
              I continued in the corridor and after a while came back. I was
              making fun of the teachers all the time as well. Especially when
              the whole group was coping the works from the excellent students
              one from another. I set right near the excellent one and then
              every single person copied. There were moments when teaches
              screamed: “I know you are copying, but I can not catch you!” They
              could not even imagine that we actually can help each other and
              work as a team. That was so much fun.
            </p>
            <p>
              The psychological faculty also was not rich with nice teaches, but
              the material was so interesting for me that it did not matter. I
              passed almost all exams for excellent marks. There was one good
              mark given by the lady whom I answered two tickets with questions
              and extra question. But as she said: “This answer is not an
              excellent one. And I know about you promise for your mom to get a
              red degree (which allows two good marks in it only). So I give you
              a good mark”. And her face was full of pride and a smile, full of
              pleasure of putting me down. It was shocking for me because this
              is a teacher of psychology, who might consult people as well. My
              morality was so strong, so such teachers were not considered as
              good examples.
            </p>
            <p>
              I mentioned before a teacher of changed states of mind subject. He
              was the one who told me about LSD, magic mushrooms and holotropic
              breathing. I was sitting in the classroom and thought I should try
              this breathing or find LSD. At those times I wanted to remember
              past lives so much. And I got luck. A good master of holotropic
              breathing was coming to the city and my friend was organizing this
              group. So I got a discount and took part. I liked the master at
              once. He was a tall man with long white hair and beard, big round
              tummy and a huge tambourine. He looked like a Santa Claus. I felt
              such a connection with the tambourine. In the first session I felt
              comfortable and asked my questions for myself during the session.
              During the session I remembered the past life for the first time.
              You might ask: “How do you know that it was not an imagination?”
              The images and the memories which were coming were fully connected
              to my sensations and feelings. Normally when someone imaging
              something there are no feelings or sensations, it is just
              pictures. So, the first I saw myself standing on a dirty road. I
              was a child around 3 or 5. I was wearing a white sleeveless
              t-shirt and shorts. My mother was a Gypsy. She left me in a random
              village just on the road. She did this because some soldiers were
              collecting kids for their needs, and my mother did not want to
              give me to them. I was standing in the middle of the road crying
              and yelling “Don’t go!”. But she left on a wooden wagon. I went
              into the village and went from one door to another showing that I
              am hungry and need food. Every house was owned by a white person
              and no-one gave me anything. At the end of the street was a
              forest. I went into it and in some time laid down on the ground
              crying and fell asleep. I woke up at night. A she-wolf was
              standing near me. She brought some berries. I ate them and fell
              asleep again. The wolf stayed by my side for the night. In the
              morning she pushed me to start walking. And our journey started.
              Sometimes I was walking on my own, other times she was caring me
              on her back. Finally, we reached an American Indians’s village.
              The tribal leader accepted me and I started living with the tribal
              witch. The witch taught me everything and the wolf stayed by my
              side. Sometimes I hunted with my wolf and the tribe. I grew up a
              beautiful and strong girl. Once the white people came. They built
              a fortress not far from our village, and they wanted to get our
              land. We did not agree to move, so we were in a conflict. One day
              I was sitting on a field and felt a strong pain in the chest, I
              realized a white man killed my wolf in the forest. I got so angry
              and full of hatred. At night, I came into the fortress and killed
              all the men. I remembered walking out of the fortress. My arms and
              face were covered with blood, the white women were screaming with
              sorrow. I came back to the tribe and the lieder accepted me. After
              a while he offered me the best man to marry. But I chose not to,
              and I became the next witch in the tribe. The sorrow of the wolf
              loss was with me till the end.
            </p>
            <p>
              In that holotropic breathing session I went through all this as
              well as some other memories shortly. Like I remembered the master
              of the session as my big white elephant. I was an Indian lady,
              very rich with a huge property and a house. The elephant was my
              servant and a friend.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also, I had a question about my spirit animal. And a face of a
              cheetah looked at me from the bush. At first, I could not believe
              because I was so attached to the American Indians and wolves. I
              was asking: “Is that you who is my spirit animal?” And then I
              turned into a cheetah, and we ran together in the desert. It was
              so great.
            </p>
            <p>
              I got up after a session fully shocked and amazed. We became close
              friends with that master. His name was Vladislav Kenga. He was the
              president of Estonian Association of Transpersonal Psychology. He
              asked me to write him emails, if I feel bad. I was writing him a
              lot and often. He was doing the sessions in Smolensk, Kaluga and
              Bryansk, and I was at every session for free as his student. I
              learned some technics, as mask therapy which I conduct now
              sometimes. Once Vlad stayed at my flat in the second room for 2
              weeks. We talked a lot. He was very supportive. I went through
              different experiences on the sessions and learned how to maintain
              them. This type of sessions was transpersonal psychology. Which is
              not very scientific, but more about your spiritual experience. At
              that time I started to consult people, so I understood that such
              sessions do not bring a resolution of inside problems.
