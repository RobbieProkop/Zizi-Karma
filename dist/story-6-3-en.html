              Kaluga was a city, where we conducted sessions with Nikolai quite
              often. I liked the city and the guy, who was my mother at the
              being born training. His name was Igor. I stayed at his place for
              a month and then rented a room. This was a first move with all my
              stuff and I had a lot of it.
            </p>
            <p>
              I found a job beforehand and a company of friends right after I
              moved to Kaluga. The company was full of artists, painters,
              musicians. We were drinking, talking and listening to the music
              hanging out in parks and streets. Twice Kaluga was really sweet to
              me. I was tight on money and twice there were situations when I
              had no money left and no food at home. I was walking home after
              work and asked Kaluga for money from the bottom of my heart and I
              found money on the street. It was around 300-400 rubbles, just
              enough to hold on till the salary.
            </p>
            <p>
              After half a year I felt the same way I felt in Smolensk. There
              was no place to grow. The city was too small for me. Luckily, the
              company I was working in decided to close our office. So in winter
              of 2010 I had to find another job, and I decided to give Moscow a
              try. I found a random job as a logistic and a room to share with
              my very old friend Kirill, who was planing to move to Moscow the
              same time. Kirill was playing an online game at night and slept in
              the morning, so we met on the sofa quite rare. We had one sofa, a
              floor carpet and a wardrobe. In the other room there was a couple.
              This place was fine for a short period of time, just an option for
              a new start. We lived together with Kirill for 2-3 months. The way
              to the job took me 1.5 hours on the metro one way plus a walk to
              the metro station around 20 min one way. So it was 3.5 hours to
              get to the office and back. I was exhausted all the time. Logistic
              in Moscow is a hell with constant traffic jams. So no-one get
              anywhere on time and all the angry calls went to me. After
              2-3months I found a room close to the work, and it made my life a
              bit easier. At that time I wanted to meet some people, so I
              started to go to banya with one company. Banya is a dry sauna with
              a higher temperature. The company there was interesting and nice.
              I was going there once in two weeks. When spring came one of the
              men invited me to a music festival. He said their friends needed a
              cook for their tea tent. And they will pay for the festival ticket
              and provide a tent and food. I agreed. At the last moment the man
              said he could not come, so I should go to the metro station where
              the tea company will pick me up. I knew no-one in it. I looked at
              the man named Yura, who was organizing a tea tent, in the social
              net. He seemed nice. I collected my stuff and decided to see him
              first and if I feel anything bad, I will refuse to go at the metro
              station. But Yura turned to be great, and we are still in contact.
              He is a kind and nice person. , and the tea company liked my
              cooking and after that festival I went with them to festivals
              during the summer. On the festivals I met with my Smolensk
              company. I was very glad to see my men and a couple of times I
              helped them cook as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              I continued my experiments with LSD, so I had a trip every
              festival. I saw different effects on people in that state
              depending on how they felt. I talked with those people, I saw
              their pain, their suffering and the roots of their suffering.
            </p>
            <p>
              At one festival I had no LSD, so I hoped to find some at the
              festival. I came with my tea company and was cooking every day.
              Once I took an early morning shift, so when a man came begging for
              food I cooked him pancakes for free. He came back in some time and
              gave me a small cube of hashish. I was surprised, because I didn’t
              smoke. Then in the afternoon my friend came saying there’s a man
              with LSD named Lyosha. Lyosha did not want to sell LSD but to
              exchange it for something. It suited me perfectly. I met Lyosha,
              and he agreed to exchange the hashish cube, I got in the morning,
              for one LSD sugar cube. Lyosha prepared sugar cubes with a drop of
              LSD in it. I was going for a trip the following night, so Lyosha
              came to our camp to look at me in the trip. I did not like him at
              first. But he seemed interested in me. The Next day I was leaving
              the festival, because my boyfriend was making drama that I’m in
              the forest for a week. So he was going to come and pick me up.
              Lyosha caught me at the last minute before I left our tea camp. He
              walked me to my meeting point, but my boyfriend was late for 2
              hours. So we set with Lyosha on the ground and talked. As I said,
              I did not feel he is the one, but he courted me really hard.
              Lyosha was the first person in my life with whom I felt loved,
              fully supported, accepted and believed in. We had trips together,
              as he was selling weed and LSD all the time. I shared with him
              everything, so he understood that I use LSD in my own productive
              way. I was always able to pull myself from any feelings and
              learned a lot about myself. It was like a room for me and I knew
              how to use it. I saw myself as a machine, a computer, a being
              consisted of lots and lots of layers. During the trips I was
              inspecting and going down from layer to layer. Lyosha suggested me
              to try to work the same way with someone. So we started having
              trips in a small group, looking in each other, observing and
              sharing what we noticed or saw. After a while I started doing
              personal sessions for people.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2011 when I met Lyosha he moved me to a vegan raw diet and lots
              of cleansing and fasting. I improved my health a lot. I became
              interested in the healthy eating very much and got the idea that
              it is nice to feed people with good food. I worked a lot in that
              sphere. I was a cook at first, then a chef, a production manager,
              top manager, and director. I worked with raw cookies and
              crispbread, raw dishes like porridges, soups and other dishes, and
              chocolate.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was giving sessions during my weekends. I learned so much with
              my clients. At first, we both were taking LSD, then I realized
              that I can connect the person without anything. I found that I can
              contact a person through the eyes and I can see what the person
              see, feel what they feel, analyse and understand their belief
              structure as well as the roots of the problem, and what could lead
              to this and how to resolve it. The only necessity was the openness
              of the person. The client should not intentionally hide from me. I
              was practicing for 5 years in Moscow. Lots of people found me and
              came. With every client I had a feeling that this is the person,
              who was supposed to come. Like I met all of them before. Sometimes
              I even remembered when and in which form I saw them last time.
              Sometimes there were people whom I often meet, sometimes the ones
              whom I have not seen for a long time. “How do you know this?” you
              might ask. When I see someone I can feel the connection with and
              sometimes there’s a feeling that I missed this person so much,
              even if we just met. Other times I feel so comfortable and
              trustful with a person I might not know well, which means for me,
              that we knew each other before, and I do not miss them, even if we
              meet once in half a year. It’s like not enough time to miss, like
              they are with me all the time.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lyosha became my husband in 1.5 year after we started dating and
              living together. He did not earn much and did not really try to
              change it. Right before the celebration and marriage party I asked
              myself if I should cancel everything, because he did not get any
              money for it. My mother and friends presented us just enough to
              pay for the rings and food. After the marriage we started walking
              down the hill. I was working a lot, and he was at home cooking
              dinner for me and giving a foot massage. It felt like I’m a man
              earning, and he is my wife. I tried to discuss it with him, but he
              always wanted to get money easily. And it never worked out. We
              were planing a kid, and Lyosha promised to stop smoking weed
              sometime before we start trying. He tried for three days and
              immediately became angry which created conflicts. He went back to
              smoking. So I made a decision we are not going to have a child
              yet. At that time I was working in a raw café. There was a team of
              20 people. I came there as a cook but went along well with the
              owner and after a month he made me a chef, and then he fired a
              manager, whom I hired as a cook after a week I became a chef. Then
              one day the owner left the office. I called his wife, and she said
              that I can become a director. She raised my salary and changed the
              schedule of work. I learned everything about the papers and met
              the landlord, whom we paid cash every month. He liked me and
              explained some details about paying the bills and going to apply
              the needed papers to some offices. The owner’s wife liked me and
              trusted to hire people, and create the company culture. That was
              one of the best time in my life. First thing I did after entering
              my office, was visiting people working in all 3 rooms and
              inspiring them for a working day. We had tea gatherings with
              sweets at the café in the evenings or at my house or park nearby.
              Everyone prepared something special for a snack. There was a
              feeling of being a family. We all gathered at the café with one
              idea of being healthy and share our experience of raw food. We
              were on the same wave and inspired and supported each other. After
              3 months of work in there I did a 40-day fasting. I had a mushroom
              trip one night and during it, I felt so dirty in the inside, so I
              decided to start fasting the following morning. First 2 weeks I
              had herbal tea with some honey, next 1 week I had one glass of
              pomegranate juice, next 3 weeks a glass of orange juice in the
              morning and one glass of pomegranate juice in the evening, and
              then I was on the apricot water and some juice for 2 weeks more.
              That was an interesting experience. I was very calm and balanced,
              because I did not really have any energy to waste. I was working
              full time at the café and resolved any arising conflicts fast. At
              that time I had massage and sauna often too. The man, who gave me
              massage, became one of my closest friends later. When spring came
              I felt like everything is clear and organized at a café, and I had
              no interest anymore. I felt like there’s no more space to grow in
              it. I left is for a start-up project for raw vegan deserts. We
              planned and did everything from a total zero. We were creating the
              production with the delivery. It took a lot of work. I was doing
              all possible roles in this. Sometimes I had to get the order, cook
              and deliver it. It was funny to play a different person on the
              phone after the order was delivered, and the client called to
              thank us. My relations with my husband became less and less close.
              I was working a lot and spent most of the weekends on the
              festivals where we sold our deserts.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the beginning of summer 2015 I went to serve in the Vipassana
              meditation centre. I tried this meditation technic in 2013 in
              April. At those times I was fully on raw, so I ate salads and some
              fruits. I got a warm shower twice in 10 days, and I had almost no
              warm clothes. I was wearing everything I had with me, and washed
              the whole set every second evening. I wrapped the clothes around
              the heater, so I can wear this again the next day. The course took
              place in the summer camp, so there were 8 people in my room. The
              beds were pretty tight to each other. During the course I
              experienced pain all the time. On day 5 I felt like I am in hell.
              I went to the conducting teacher, and she gave me some very
              general answer and nothing helpful to reduce my pain. I was always
              hungry, cold, tired and in pain. It was hard. But I went through
              it, and on day 10 a man shared a full spoon of honey with tea with
              me. It was fantastic.
            </p>
            <p>
              So, I went to serve almost after 2 years. The serving was amazing!
              The team was so warm and nice. We were laughing all the time. The
              conducting teacher was the head of Vipassana in Russia. He was
              very understanding and we were working hard. In that serving I met
              3 people, who effected my life. First 2 were a nice couple, who
              seemed interesting. The girl was talking unusual things about the
              universe and our connection and some other stuff about past lives.
              The 3d person was a man I was attracted sexually to. It was so
              unusual, because I was married, and have never seen anyone as a
              man except my husband. I started asking myself about my marriage
              and my husband, about everything that happened. I also discussed
              this with that new girl, and she said that my husband is totally
              not a match for me. I don’t know what was happening, but I trusted
              that girl 100%. Soon after the course I decided to leave my
              husband. I felt like our story is over. I remembered some past
              lives together with him. And everything felt over. That we gave
              the lessons we were supposed to give each other. When I told my
              decision my husband cried and said he will do anything to save the
              marriage, but he did not really do anything. Everything remained
              the same for a month or two, and then I decided to move out, and
              we will apply for the divorce.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was in contact with that couple from the course, and now it
              feels like I was kind of hypnotized. The girl asked me to throw
              away all the things which were my protecting stuff like small
              figures of demons, creatures and some stuffed animals. I left all
              of them in the street. Also, I told them about my pet. The girl
              said I should let him go. He is kind of demon, so I should clarify
              myself. So, one day I called him and told him that I want to let
              him go. He agreed. And I did a kind of meditation with him, I send
              him all my love and gratitude for all those years taking care of
              me. He accepted it all and turned into a shining vessel which
              meant that he moved to an upper level of being. I have never seen
              him again.
            </p>
            <p>
              I left my husband and was going to visit the couple in
              Saint-Petersburg. On the train back to Moscow after the course I
              met a man from Cheboksary. He looked like a lost and shy child for
              me. I talked with him a lot and hugged him at the end. I gave him
              my phone number and have not heard anything from him till the last
              night before going to visit that couple. This man from Cheboksary
              called me in the evening saying he had to see me. I told him that
              I’m busy, and I’m leaving the city tomorrow. He was strongly
              insisting and finally, I agreed to have tea with him during the
              night. He picked me up on his car, and we went to my rented room.
              When I made tea, snacks, and we set down in my room. He started
              talking, and I saw and heard an absolutely different person. It
              felt like another soul was talking from this body. I have never
              experienced anything like this before or after. It felt like
              someone is talking through this man’s body. The man started
              talking about the couple I was going to visit. He said they are
              dangerous, they are misleading me. The fog fell of me and I
              started seeing clearly and became more attentive to his words.
              Previous 3 years I was absolutely concentrated on the heart area.
              I was very loving and giving. He said this will change. The energy
              will move up to the thought area, which means I will start looking
              for self-expression and realization. The concentration will go on
              myself. We were talking the whole night, and it felt like I was
              talking not to a human. But to someone, who sees more than I do
              and knows my future. I almost decided to cancel my trip, but
              realized I should go and check what the person said. He dropped me
              at the bus stop and I have never seen him again. When I arrived to
              Saint-Petersburg I was very attentive. The couple behaved like I
              am their child. It was extremely odd. They were having lots of
              stuffed animals at home and called them their kids. I saw their
              inner desire to have a real child, but the man was too scared of
              the responsibility, so they did not develop in the relations.
              After a couple of hours after my arrival we were cooking with the
              girl, and she asked if I told anything anyone about them. And I
              said that I shared some information with a man. The girl got mad
              and said I betrayed them and I did go through a special checking.
              We spent a day together, which was super awkward. I left them next
              day and was happy to go back home.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I left my husband at first I was shocked sitting in a room I
              started to rent, but after a short time I felt free and happy
              again. In September 2015 I went to sit my second Vipassana course
              and was thinking about chocolate all the time. I thought that I
              should get the job, which was offered before the course. The job
              was a manager in a small chocolate production. The production was
              in the tiny village 100 km from Moscow. It was a 4-story house.
              They offered me a privet room and a salary of 40000 rubbles a
              month. I thought it might help to change the surrounding. I was
              walking a lot in the forest, set on the bench on a hill, spent all
              the time with nature. The closest store was a 40-min walk away.
              There was nothing around. There were 8 people living in the house,
              others were coming for work from another village. The food did not
              suit me. The company never paid me what was promised. I left
              everything behind and had nowhere to go, so I stayed. Probably the
              boss knew it and used it. Every time he was saying that I’m still
              studying or this is what you earned this month. It was almost
              always 30,000. At some point I started to work 6 days a week. It
              seemed I lived on my work. At the begging I remembered my
              ex-husband a lot. I wished he will find me, come and bring me
              home. But he never did. The home did not exist anymore and the
              idea of marriage and all the illusions about it were ruined.
              Everything changes. Anyone can one day change one’s mind and
              leave. There were people with disabilities on the production. And
              one day a boy arrived to the house. He had problems with
              communication. At the same time the boss decided to open a night
              shift. I was teaching a new team for the night and this weird boy
              how to clean our room. Every morning he knocked and yelled at my
              door: “it’s breakfast!” I have never had breakfast on my weekend.
              So this wake up was horrible. At one point I felt myself as if I
              was in a mad house. People were weird and I worked as a horse.
              Once I had 26 hours shift. I worked with the old team in the day
              and then checked the new night team. That night they were working
              with a milk chocolate. We had lots of problems with the recipe, so
              the mashing stuck after they finished making the mixture. The boss
              left with his girlfriend to Moscow for the weekend. So the team
              woke me up and the machine was totally stuck. I asked the man, who
              was looking after the house and technical stuff kind of a steward,
              to bring the team home. And when he was back we started to knock
              out the pistol in the middle of the machine. Finally, we got it
              out, and I washed everything till the morning and then made a plan
              for a new day, because the team needed to work through the day.
              Shortly after this, we hired a new man named Pasha from Moscow. I
              liked him immediately because he was normal. We stared walking
              together in the forest, had tea for hours and talked a lot. Pasha
              was a pretty soft guy even he was really tall with amazing very
              long hair and huge beard. So I started teaching him and another
              boy from the village everything about our work and machines. I
              worked with 2 boys and the other team was 2 girls. They were
              always laughing at Pasha and his beard. My boys made mistakes like
              not collecting the machine properly, forgetting to close the tap,
              and the chocolate will go through it from the side right on the
              floor. Once a boy dropped a huge jar with honey and covered half
              of the room with it. So at those times there was lots of work,
              food and fun. I gained 10 kg in 3 months. I was always tired and
              hungry. The company fed us with potato, bread, cheese, oatmeal and
              cabbage. For me, it was a killing diet. Especially after 80
              percent raw. We got close with a Pasha. He added some light to the
              dark place I was in. I wanted to go to India for 3 years before
              that job and my ex-husband promised to take me there, and he never
              did. So after our divorce I made my mind to go to India in winter.
              I had a deal with a man I met in Vipassana meditation centre that
              he will meet me in Goa, and we will rent a house together. So I
              was working at a factory collecting all the money for this trip. I
              thought I will take a month trip as a vacation. But one more thing
              happened at that house.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was communicating a lot with the steward because we always had
              some issues around the house. One morning I woke up because he
              entered my room. There were no locks on the doors. I was sleeping
              naked and the man laid in my bed, hugged me and stated to kiss me
              with a crazy desire. I was shocked. I could not stand up because
              this would turn him on even more, and he might get absolutely out
              of control. So I stayed under the blanket captured by my
              co-worker. I started to ask him to leave, to understand what he
              was doing. I told him that he should leave right and not to commit
              anything bad. Finally, my words reached him, and came back to his
              senses, realizing what he was doing. He jumped up and ran away. He
              was a man around 60. His wife was in Crimea. And he was working in
              the house.
            </p>
            <p>
              I don’t know what this man imagined. I did not go to breakfast
              that day. It was my rest day. I got an SMS from this old man (the
              steward) that he was extremely sorry of what he has done. I’ve
              never replied. I did not see him after this. He was always
              avoiding me, and this was helpful for me. I did not say anyone
              except Pasha about this. And he said this was my fault. I was
              shocked. I shared the horror and got no support and even blame.
              His arguments were that I was always kind, nice and helpful with
              the old man. So he could easily image that I like him. But really!
              Who would do such a thing?! Anyway I decided I am not going to
              come back after this one-month vacation in India, so I bought a
              one way ticket and saved as much as I could.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the end of November 2015 I told the boss that I’m not going to
              come back, so I suggested a boy from my team to take my place. I
              thought the boy everything during December and flew to Goa, India.
