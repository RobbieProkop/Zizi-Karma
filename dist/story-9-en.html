            <p>It was my second trip to India. It was the end of October 2018. We landed in Goa and got to the village we were going to live by local buses. It took us a while, and I was very tired, when we got to Arambol. At first, we rent a pretty expensive room, but then I found an inexpensive room on the main road by the Nepalese Café Umbrella. We covered the windows with scarfs, because everything in the room was seen from the street. It was a loud place with lots of tourists and cafés around. In December our friend Miron invited us to go to Rishikesh, which is in the north not far from Delhi. Ramon was organizing his trip to India providing the money support. We left Goa on the 31 of December, because the flights were cheap. We got up early and got to the Airport by 3 local buses. Then we took a flight to Delhi and then 2 more local buses to Rishikesh. We found ourselves in Rishikesh around 6 in the morning January the first 2019. The city lies in the mountains and the view is amazing. It was freezing after hot Goa, and we had only warm scarfs. We found a room fast and the hot shower helped to warm us, so we can go eat and buy some warm clothes. We lived it several rooms trying to find the most suitable. Miron arrived and told us that his friend Ksyusha is coming soon. Before her arrival we lived in two separate rooms, small but clean. I cooked us food on a small gas-burner. It was tight and inconvenient. Ksyusha arrived and found a big two-room flat with a big balcony, kind of living room and kitchen. We did not have a fridge, but there was a hot shower, gas stove and Wi-Fi. It was more than enough. The young man looking after the house was also nice. Two weeks before moving to this flat we were walking with Ramon in the city, and he said a phrase, which pressed some button in me. He said: “You know, I think I’m pressing you too much”. The world stopped. I suddenly realized how much I was suppressed, pushed and changed. My real self appeared to be lost somewhere deep inside. Lots of anger arose, and I became inconvenient and rude with Ramon. I started telling him all I don’t like and did not take him seriously anymore. He mentioned once that, if I will continue this behaviour, our relations will finish. He did not try to resolve anything or even discuss what was going on. The morning we were going to move in a new apartment with Ksyusha, Ramon said that maybe it’s better to separate, and I will live in the room with Ksyusha and he with Miron. I agreed. Ksyusha was not happy, she hoped to live with Miron. But the decision was made, we separated. I was travelling without a job as you know. So Ramon promised to support me financially till I find a job. He wanted me to continue studying. After a couple of days living with a stranger in the room, and my ex and a friend, I got diarrhea. It was a psychosomatic reaction, I could not digest the situation I was in. I was with 3 people in the flat and no-one asked if I need help. They were all hanging out together, walking, eating out, having a good time. I felt as an outsider and tried to search, what should I buy in the medical store, when I will be able to leave the house for some time. For 5 days I could not leave the house and did not really eat. On the 6th day I ran to a medical store and bought some pills. The next week was easier because I was on the pills all the time. Diarrhea passed after 10 days. I was leaving with a company, but most time I spent studying in the room alone. In the middle of February the time of Mooji Satsang came. I felt I want to serve with their team, and they accepted me for a month. It was an interesting time for me. Mooji is a spiritual teacher. When he entered the ashram we all gathered in, I felt a huge wave of unconditional love. I felt the love coming from this person, which went right in my heart and deep inside. I felt how much I don’t love myself, how much I don’t accept in me, how much I criticize myself. And this stranger, who have never seen me, loves me and accepts me right now. I’ve never experienced anything like this. I cried at once. This was incredible. The size of the ashram was big enough for 3000 people to comfortably sit, plus a bookshop area, and a big dining hall on the territory. As you see it was a big area, and I felt him entering the gates of it. Mooji is definitely an unusual person, very loving and present. I was serving in an entrance team, so we showed everyone the entrance, toilets and exit. We organized the crowd. We started early every morning, so I got luck to catch tuk-tuk every time. A tuk-tuk is a 3 wheeled small car with holes as windows and no door. Normally there are 2 benches and one/two seats by the driver. I met an interesting guy, named Ty, from the United States, who invited me for a dinner once, and with whom I experienced a long warm hug which let my pain raise up and pass away. The pain of absence of the father, home, love, acceptance, and support  was coming and going, and I felt unconditionally loved and accepted by this man, the stranger. He was very warm and silent. We set in silence in a hug at the restaurant listening to the life music and loving each other as it is. We were just there, without any roles or relations, we were just there as a warmth and love for each other and our selves. Our connection touched  the man sitting near us. He tried to give us a smoothie, but we refused to take it. We were so full. And then I saw how much he does not love himself. I asked him if he wanted a hug. He started crying, and we took him in our hug. We sat together, three of us, seeing each other for the first time. Letting each other close in the heart and in the hug, feeling each other breathing, feeling the warmth of our bodies, the deep connection and trust. The man was crying in our arms with Ty like a small boy. It was beautiful. After some time the man felt better and when he stood up to say goodbye he appeared to be a huge tall man. I was surprised. He felt so small and weak in my arms. I spent some time with these two men during the Satsang period. We had lots of hugs every time we saw each other, and we took a couple of walks and dinners. At that time my meditation and concentration was very strong. The Mooji’s energy, presence and love was with me. I felt changed, I felt like I am love, I felt lots of love to others, I felt light and happy. Serving is my favorite thing to do. When I do this, my life is easy and clear, all the task are settled, and I just need to do, what I should and these actions are for the benefit of others. This is my task, this is what I’m here for. During the Satsang period, the ashram near our was giving lunch for a donation. I ate there almost every day. It was amazing spicy Indian food. It was an Indian thali: rice, dhal made from red lentils, chapati(wheat thin bread), chickpea bread, fried vegetables, cauliflower with potatoes, and kurd(made from milk, kind of sour cream). During the Satsang I felt very calm, safe and relaxed. I asked India for the best job for me. There was an interesting part of the Satsang program were bhajans. Bhajans are singing holy words from Indian religious texts in a big group of people. Mooji sanga(community) has their own music team which plays music for bhajans and other gatherings. The holy words are shown on the wall with the projector, so anyone can sing. There were 3 or 4 bhajans during the sating period, and I went to each of those. It’s a powerful feeling to be a part of something bigger, to be a part of a big smiling community, being huge every day. You are not alone anymore you are a part of something. In some sense you are better than you were before. Your association with yourself as a human is fading away, and you start associating with yourself as love. It’s a very pleasant feeling. You don’t want negative things near you, and you see life through this association of yourself. The only thing with is not in this teaching is morality. Everything will be accepted and as you are love people want to share this feeling. So they start flirting with anyone they like, having intimate relations, having open relations, and cheat on their partners. And they don’t really see what’s wrong with this. They just share their feeling of love. They love each other at that moment. That’s it. So there’s no determination on stable monogram relations with responsibilities. I met some people doing all this and it effected me and was not nice. During the sating period I lived with 3 Estonian people and one Russian. It was very nice, comfortable living together. We cooked together, shared meals, spent time together a lot.</p>
            <p>At the end of the season the Estonians left the flat and my friend Katerina, with whom I served at Vipassana meditation centre once, moved in. I lived with Katerina for 2 months. At that time I just got a job as a website designer. My ex-boyfriend Ramon suggested me to his boss, and they took me almost without knowledge. I was standing and working a lot. At the end of March Ramon bought me a ticket to Nepal as our Indian visas were coming to the end. Two weeks before the decision to go there I was near the holy Ganga river and made a wish. I asked India for a real family. I wished it with all my heart, asking for the best for me. </p>
            <p>Our flight to Nepal was on the 10th of April. I was going together with Ramon, and I had the feeling that someone is waiting me there. That feeling was very clear and strong. I knew nothing about Nepal, but I felt I should go to Pokhara. I heard this name somewhere and decided to figure everything out when I got there.</p>
            <p>So everything was decided and settled. 10th of April 2019 I’m going to Nepal with some monetary support from Ramon and a promise from my boss to start paying me soon.</p>
