              <p class="hello">Hello!</p>
              <p>
                My name is Yulia and I am a certified psychologist. For 12 years
                I have been working with people and dealing with a wide range of
                difficulties that can arise in relationships with people. I also
                consider the difficulties in understanding myself, my
                self-awareness and worldview. In my work, I devote a lot of time
                to working with fears, basic attitudes, behavioral patterns,
                beliefs, as well as intrinsic motivation and goals. Client focus
                is an important aspect in my practice.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="text">
              <p>
                Through my practice, I have found that most of the difficulties
                we face now have their roots in childhood, which is obviously
                not a secret for you. Therefore, the resolution of current
                difficulties is in remembering, living and analyzing the moments
                when they first arose. Causal relationships permeate our life in
                everything and what we are now is the result of the events that
                happened to us, the emotions and sensations that we experienced
                and the conclusions that we made on the basis of the above.
                Becoming aware of and recognizing our own feelings and emotions
                is key in releasing old trauma, emotion, and energy. Everything
                that happened to us throughout life is neatly stored in our
                memory. All unconscious, not accepted and not expressed
                emotions, remain in the unconscious. Our psyche is an incredible
                substance that can create amazing things to protect its safety
                in an adequate state. Difficult situations that we face generate
                our emotions and reactions and sometimes remain like clamps in
                the body when we cannot cope with them. Clamps are places in the
                body that are constantly in unconscious tension. Releasing
                memories, emotions associated with them, and understanding the
                conclusions that we have made relieves tension in the body and
                makes it possible to reconsider what we think, how we do it and
                whether or not we believe in it.
              </p>
              <p>
                The main areas of my work are looking at relationships with the
                father, the mother and the self. The relationship with the dad
                determines our relationship with all male people, since the
                father is the first example and experience of interaction with
                people of this gender. The nature of the relationship with dad
                also affects our sense of security in the world / in life, the
                degree of orientation in the material world and the ability to
                express ourselves in activities and realize ourselves as a
                person. Relationship with mom defines our relationship with all
                female people, the first example and experience of interaction
                with people of this gender, as well as our ability to recognize,
                understand, accept and express emotions and feelings. Our
                relationship with mom is about feeling accepted, understood,
                loved.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unconditional love that comes from parents to us is often unseen
                by the conventions of adequate behavior, which they are trying
                to teach us in accordance with social norms and subjective
                understandings. The value system often becomes imposed and does
                not resonate with us. In this regard, I take the time to review
                existing beliefs, recognize the true ones and discard those that
                are no longer relevant. This work allows you to restructure the
                behavior and attitude to many things.
              </p>
              <p>
                As a rule, the main spectrum of difficulties is associated with
                relationships with parents and, as a result, with partners. In
                working with them, we naturally recognize ourselves and get rid
                of the unnecessary. After bringing these aspects into a healthy
                state, you can move on to finding your own business,
                self-realization and motivation. We will touch on these issues
                as we resolve difficulties with parents, but a sense of our
                potential, our own integrity and fulfillment often comes when we
                are alright in the first two aspects.

          <!-- Steps -->
          <div class="steps">
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <div class="flex-items">
              <div class="icon icon-1">
                <img src="../icons/counseling.png" alt="" />

                  The first step in my practice is to find out where we are.
                  This step shows how you feel, what is happening or has
                  happened, and what you want to change. Change is something
                  that always happens in my practice. You will change and your
                  life and environment will follow you. Therefore, before you
                  start, ask yourself: "Do I want changes? Am I ready to work in
                  this direction?" <br />
                  A psychologist is not a magic pill that you can take and get
                  results without doing anything. A psychologist is a person who
                  knows what to do and how to get where you want to go. This is
                  the person who knows what a healthy situation looks like and
                  what needs to be done to get into it. In my work, I often use
                  visualizations. In my opinion, this is a very simple and
                  effective method to detect real emotions, experiences and the
                  state of affairs at the level of emotions. By visualizing
                  something, we easily and immediately imagine what it is. We
                  deliberately give permission for everything to take place,
                  since this is what we represent, this is not serious, and it
                  can be anything. In practice, however, we tell what we
                  actually feel.

                <p>
                  The second step is analyzing what we found in the first step
                  and understanding what we want and setting goals. At this
                  stage, we discuss how things are, draw parallels and
                  cause-and-effect relationships between the pictures that we
                  created in the course of working with visualizations and the
                  emotions and sensations that you experience. We also identify
                  inappropriate moments in roles with parents, false beliefs and
                  attitudes and what does not suit you. Next, we will explore
                  what exactly we will change and set specific goals and
                  objectives.

              <div class="icon icon-3">
                <img src="../icons/mental-health.png" alt="" />

              <div class="flex-text text-3">
                <p>
                  The third step is the therapy itself. The main methods in my
                  approach are talking and working with visualizations. I take a
                  holistic approach and therefore at the end of the session I
                  often give practices and assignments that you can use in
                  between our meetings. I also provide online support between
                  sessions. <br />
                  In my practice, I noticed that often people need time to tune
                  in to our work, talk about events between sessions, just
                  exhale and stop, so instead of the usual hour, I have around
                  two hour sessions.
