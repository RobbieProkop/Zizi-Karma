            <p>
              I arrived in Goa, India on the 28th of December 2015. The air was
              hot and humid. And it felt like I arrived home. It was a totally
              new but familiar feeling. My friend picked me on a scooter from the
              airport. The first thing we’ve done after leaving the airport was
              to have a glass of cane sugar in the middle of the dirty road. The
              man was making it on the wooden cart. The drink was very good and
              stayed one of my favourite still. I was so amused by India. It was
              very colourful. We stayed in a small village called Kerim in the
              north of Goa. Next to it was a touristic place with lots of Russians
              called Arambol. We rented a house with a guy and his friend. 2015
              was the worst year for Russians to go to India because the exchange rate was
              2 Russian rubbles to 1 Indian rupee. I did not have many savings.
              After one month I found a job online doing hidden marketing of a
              new social net from the Ukraine. The guy paid me very good but
              after a month I was sick of it and decided to find another job. My
              mother and grandmother sent me some money to hold on. I found a
              job in another city as a massage girl. They said they will teach
              me everything and checked my photos. They paid for my flight and
              picked me up on three cars. It was a long way to the city where I
              was supposed to work. When I entered a flat I was provided to live
              I realized I definitely got in troubles. The flat stank as a sex
              hangout. I went in my room, locked the door and spend a night
              showed lying in my sleeping bag. The next morning I was picked up and
              brought to the main office. I was dressed as usual, very long
              skirt and closed t-shirt and a scarf. When I entered the
              administration room I saw a very show blonde girl in a super short
              dress, long hair full make up and hills. She was standing in front
              of the massage room waiting for a client. When the boss saw me he
              was disappointed, he said I look like an Indian girl, and we should
              buy me nice open clothes. I got the first lesson with this blond
              girl. She was Ukrainian. She appeared to live in the same flat I
              stayed, and she told me the details of the work. Here they are: you
              are wearing open short dress, you do a strong massage on the back
              side of the client’s body. Indians are very tense and sexually
              suppressed, so you need to work with the legs and back really hard.
              Then the client turns around. He is in underwear and you jump on
              the table, and sit their touching his chest and smiling. The girl
              should sit in a way that the client sees her underwear and boobs. He, of
              course, gets turned on and goes into the shower to release himself. Then you smile
              and touch his hand saying you'll be waiting for him next time.
              This time of goodbye can provide a good tip. The blonde girl said
              she almost always gets 2000 rupees extra. We did not practice
              anything, she was just sharing the knowledge and details of the
              work. I felt like throwing up right after the class, and the feeling did not
              leave. I came home, played down and started to look for a train or
              bus to get out of this. I felt I can not do such a job, no
              matter how good they pay. I found a train that left once a week going for 14
              hours straight to Goa. Late that night a man, who brought me to the
              flat and did all the pick-ups, invited me to go out for a drink. I
              refused him saying I’m tired. He was a boss’s brother. He said
              “alright for now, but you will go with me in a couple of days.” You
              might ask: “What the hell were you thinking going to this job?
              Getting the job in the middle of India from Indians doing
              massage?” I can’t really say. I felt this would be safe with a
              slight feeling that I’m going right into troubles. I came to India
              to learn how to trust the world, the life. So, the next morning I went
              to another massage place to learn how to do massage from a Thai
              girl. The girls in that office were tiny. There were 3 Thai girls
              and 1 Indian. The Indian girl looked 14-16. She looked like a child
              wearing a Sari. A Thai girl told me that they have a contract for 5
              years, and they live all together in a house. Their contract was to
              wear comfortable closed suits, but they provided hand jobs. She
              showed me the normal massage with we practiced on the boss’s
              brother. I felt such a disgusted to that dark hairy body. I
              realized I would never date an Indian. After that lesson he said
              next day I should take the first client. I said that I feel bad,
              and I want to rest till tomorrow. The boss agreed, and I ran to the
              railway station. I was looking for a window in which they would
              understand English. Finally, I found it and there were no tickets
              with the place on the only train this evening. It was my only
              chance to run away. The ticket with the place means you will have
              a place to sit or lay down. If you get a ticket without the place
              it means you are allowed to get into the train if you succeed
              cause there’s a huge number of people with same ticket, so you need
              to get on the train and try to sit on the floor, this would be
              your place for the journey. Sometimes families can occupy the toilet,
              and they will not leave it, so that would be their tiny room for
              the whole family with kids. I was standing in front of the window
              asking for a ticket with a seat, but he said there were no tickets. A
              couple of Indians tried to find a bus for me but nothing was going
              to Goa that day. The train was the only chance. After 1.5 hours of
              trying to find anything else I saw to myself: “Alright India, this
              is my only chance. Time me what you give. I will accept it.” I came
              to the window and asked for one ticket. The man gave me the ticket
              smiling. I looked in it and there was a number of my place. I was
              so happy. I thanked the man and went home to pack. I came home and
              met another girl from Ukraine. She just arrived and was also
              shocked. She was around 40. She said she came for the money, and
              she is going to stay does not matter what. She told me that the
              previous girls in this flat were providing sexual service, and
              brought massage clients to the flat for this. They earned a lot
              and ran away with all the money. Then, the woman left to the
              office and I immediately packed my backpack and ran to the railway
              station. If you’ve ever been to India, you know that the ticket does not
              mean that the train or a bus will be there. If the train or a bus
              is late it means a good luck because it showed up. My train was
              late for 2 hours, but it did show up. I was so happy. This was my
              ticket from hell. My friend was going to meet me in Goa, and my
              boss called me at night when they found out that I am not in the
              flat. I wrote him that I am very sorry, but I can not do this type
              of work. My place in the train was in the 2c car. It is the car where
              there are 2 rows with 3 open benches and one raw on the side of 2
              benches. My bench was in the middle of 5 young Indian men going to
              have fun in Goa. They were very loud, and started drinking. I got
              lucky again. One of their friends got a bench on the side 2 rows
              from them, so they asked me to switch the benches with him. I had a
              good sleep, and consulted my bench neighbour about his divorce in
              the morning.

              It was a great relief to be back to people I know, and the touristic
              area. My friend went to Laos for a visa run and brought back a big box
              with cool postcards. A visa run is when you go to a
              neighbouring country to renew your visa to the country you were just in. Normally, a visa run is a very short trip, which is just long enough to get all the documents
              done. After his return, we sold postcards on the beach during the
              night beach market. We paid 30 rupees to mafia to take care of the
              police. They collected 30 rupees from each so-called "shops", so that the
              police do not come to check the beach. Sometimes there were
              police raids to stop this market, so the mafia guys ran to us and
              said the police is coming you should hide everything. And everyone
              hid their stuff and just sat on the beach till they leave. We sold
              most of the postcards and decided to move to another city. A
              friend of my friend decided to accompany us. He had no more money
              but borrowed some from my friend. We got to Gokarna by train. I
              was usual short distance train with seats and fans, very dirty and
              full of plastic garbage.
            </p>
            <p>
              We got to the city from the train station in the late afternoon.
              We waited for the bus for long time. There’s almost no scale for
              such local buses. We found a disgusting cheap room on the beach.
              There were 2 ripped madrases and lots of big dead and alive
              cockroaches, scorpions and spiders. We got rid of all of them and
              put the mattresses by the wall. We set a tent on the concert slab
              in the corner of the room. Our friend stayed outside by the fire.
              In the morning we moved into the jungles. There was a big property
              with a big house with several washrooms and toilets, 6-8 small one-room houses, big kitchen and big area for handicraft works. Also,
              there were jungles as a garden. All the rooms were occupied, so we
              paid for a place on the property to put the tent, and we were allowed
              to use all the facilities. This place was on the top of a big
              hill, so if you need fruits or anything you have to go down to the
              city. At that place I met Sebastian. He was a sweet European man.
              We noticed each other on the first day. He was smiling and playing
              with eyes every time we met. One day I went to the beach with some
              other people and we took a shortcut through someone's property. I
              was wearing a long skirt and a dog bit me without any warnings
              or sounds. I just felt pain and heaviness on the leg. I opened my
              skirt and saw 4 deep holes and a shocked dog near me. We left the
              property and as we reached the beach I sat down, bleeding. The boys
              ran to find some help. I washed the wounds and a big cow came to
              me. She laid down around me and pushed my body slightly with her
              huge head. It was a nice support at that moment. My friends
              brought me turmeric powder. I put the power inside each deep whole
              full of blood. There were 4 of them. My friend was insisting on
              getting the injection from rabies which they make in the belly. I
              did not feel like I need it. We made a deal if there would be a
              scooter at the place we borrow it and go to the city if not we stay
              there. There was no scooter and on the way to the tent we met a
              yang man. He said his mother was getting him ready for this trip,
              so he had a first aid kit. I took some bands and a small bottle of
              iodine. Near our tent there were tons of big red ants, which bit
              my legs and feet all the time. Every time when I was working on
              the words they were just eating me alive. In 4 days the winds got
              batter. The turmeric powder did a great job of disinfection and
              healing. I started again walking to the beach and thinking to go
              back to Russia, because I was almost out of money and did not want
              to stay with the men I travelled before. I searched for a job in
              Moscow, and my café’s boss was looking for a director of their
              shop. I wrote him, and he agreed to hire me for this position. I
              borrowed money for the flight from my travelling partner and some
              money from my mother to hold on for the first month in Moscow. Once I arrived in Moscow, I
              found a bed in a 3-room apartment. There were 5 beds per room, but
              the guy seemed nice and it was in a walk distant from my job. The
              price was also very suitable. So everything was settled and there
              was around a week left before the flight.
            </p>
            <p>
              One evening we were having tea with a small company at the place.
              Sebastian joined us and we started talking about healthy lifestyle,
              searching for meaning in life and other pretty deep things. Before
              going to sleep he promised to land me an interesting book. We went
              to his room and I stopped near the entrance. He was saying
              something and looking for a book. He said come here inviting me
              inside deeper and when I entered the room he hugged me and kissed.
              I was confused. I definitely liked him, but I was staying in the
              tent with another man and I was leaving soon. I had no intimacy
              with that man, it was kind of travelling partnership. So I did not
              say anything to Sebastian, took the book and left. The next evening I
              was passing the handicraft area to take the shower before going to
              bed and he called me. At that time in Gokarna it was so hot and
              humid that I was wearing just the big thin scarf. So I came to say
              hello to Sebastian, but he immediately switched off the light and
              started hugging me and kissing. I pushed him and said "what are you
              doing?!" He was laughing. And then he said "come to my room after
              your shower." I stood there in the darkness, listening to myself. I
              felt I should do it. I should go, I don’t know why, but I felt
              this person is supposed to teach me something. This understanding
              was bright and clear. I was leaving in 3 days. I agreed.
            </p>
            <p>
              I took a shower with a company of frogs, who sat there on the
              walls all the time. I went to my tent to check how my friend is doing.
              It was an unusually quiet evening in the place. It seemed like
              everybody went to bed early that night. My friend was sleeping, so
              I turned back and went to Sebastian’s room. The door was slightly
              open and he immediately invited me in. The room smelt pleasant
              with the strong smell of incense and tiny candles.
              We sat on the bed and our night started. It is hard to express the
              process or sensations. It was definitely an experience of tantra
              sex, which is not so much about the act, but rather about breathing together,
              touching, and observing. We were connected on all layers of a human
              being. I felt so accepted, loved, cared. I was out of shape, with
              thin long hair, lost. And this man, a stranger, took me right in
              his heart, arms and body. It was fantastic pleasure and
              relaxation. It was an act of unconditional love, and we were
              making it. Sometimes I was fully pushed out of my body, I was in
              the space, without the body, just the observing mind. At the end,
              in the morning I felt a ball of light in my lower body rising from
              it and leaving the room in the sky. That ball was a creation of
              us, the result of our love at the moment of here and now. We were
              100% present, open and connected. It was an absolutely amazing
              experience. It was still dark when we were finished. It was early
              morning, and we went for a walk. There was no one in the street. We
              went to the beach and swam with the shiny plankton. Our bodies
              were shining laying on the surface of the ocean. It was like a
              miracle. The last present from India. I knew this is only a one time
              thing with this man. We talked about relations and both did not
              want any at that moment. So we just added each other on Facebook.
              The next morning I went to see a huge statue of shiva with my
              companion. I was so sleepy that on the way back I almost fell from
              the bike. My friend decided to drive me to the airport on the
              scooter, it was a 4-hour ride. It was very nice help. I kissed him
              and said goodbye. I have never seen any of them again.
