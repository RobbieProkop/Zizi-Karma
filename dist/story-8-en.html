              I landed in Moscow in the middle of March. It was cold and gray. I
              was very lucky to catch the last train to the city and my friend
              Denis met me with winter coat and shoes at his metro station. He
              gave me a warm bath and a sofa to sleep. I was glad to see him
              again and told him about my adventures. The next day I moved into
              the room with 3 more girls and a man. There were around 10 people
              in the flat, but luckily our schedules were so different that I
              was always on time with a free bathroom and kitchen. I jumped in
              the work right in. There were around 20 people in the team. During
              the work I found a case of corruption from 2 people. They were
              getting extra money from the companies, so we would sell their
              goods at the store. I found this out and fired those men. I was
              building a friendly atmosphere in the company, and this case was
              surprising and disappointing. I left the company after 6 months.
              The boss’s girlfriend started criticizing me, and they were always
              smoking weed on our meetings away from the office. I got tired of
              this treatment and decided to leave. The team said: “We will fight
              for you! We are the family! We want you to stay”. But no-one did
              anything. On the last day I came in Pikachu suit. You know that
              yellow creature from the anime. It was a great day. Only one girl
              also came in a suit. She was a Super girl with a small towel as a
              cape. We made lots of photos and had a nice lunch together.
            </p>
            <p>
              After this job, something broke in me. No-one did anything to make
              me stay and “our family” did not really matter. I lived in a tiny
              studio and felt very lonely. Whole life I was giving, giving,
              giving. And then I was again at the age of my life alone. I got
              the same feeling that I do, care and give, and those people don’t
              care about me. I was consulting people on my weekends charging
              close to nothing, and they took it as it is. I felt deep
              disappointment and emptiness. I went through this day by day.
              After the shop I started again with the start-up we built in the
              previous year. I collected a good team of reliable people, taught
              them everything I knew about our deserts and cooking process. I
              was cooking lunch for the team. In September, I got a call from my
              ex-husband Alyosha. He invited me for coffee and wanted me back. I
              was glad to see him and I knew he did not understand why we
              divorced. We moved together with a Korean guy, his companion on
              selling sea creatures. We lived in someone’s one-room flat, then 3
              rooms flat, then we were kicked out from it, because they did not
              pay the landlord. I paid my part and they did not. That flat was
              far away from my job, and I was again working like a devil. I
              realized this is enough. I took Alyosha, moved two of us in
              another flat, and explained that this way of earning money harmed
              the living beings and this is wrong. He went to visit his parents
              and think over what he wanted to do in life. He came back with his
              small dog, we lived before with and a friend who was broke. He was
              a man with the wife and 3 kids. He sent them to Thailand while he
              will figure out something. This guy Denis stayed with us till the
              new year. A couple of days before The New Year day I decided to
              get long colorful braids made with fake hair. I did not like the
              girl, who was making them, as well as her apartment and the whole
              atmosphere. The way home took me 2 hours on the metro. During
              those two hours I was feeling those braids. I did not like them at
              all. They were heavy, unpleasant and odd. Just like the master I
              got them from. I came home and Denis was there. I sat in front of
              a mirror and decided to shave. I took scissors and cut all the
              braids. Then I asked Denis to shave me, I could not do it on my
              own. It was a very intimate and trusting act. He felt so touched
              by my trust. And he was confused and shy with red chicks every
              time I looked at him. Denis was a tall strong man, but then he
              looked like a quite nice boy. We celebrated The New Year together
              with Alyosha, Denis, and one more man. We were in an LSD trip.
              Denis opened his heart with all the pain and told me his story. I
              felt him close and that I meet him rear in lives. He said he
              missed me so much.
            </p>
            <p>
              That night my ex-husband told me that he understood why we
              divorced. The reason was that he was not ready for it, he is not
              ready for the responsibility. I agreed. He left me the next
              morning. They went to Crimea with Denis. He promised to come back
              for me and the dog, and help financially. He left on the first of
              January 2017. I stayed in a two-room flat, and I had no money to
              pay for it alone. He promised to give money, so I thought that’s
              fine, I just start looking for a neighbour. In the beginning of
              January I got an offer from my boss to create a professional video
              about raw deserts. She promised 30% plus 15000 rubbles for the 2
              days of scooting and a contract. I needed money and I agreed. I
              also felt this need of sharing my 6 years of experience in this
              field. I had one week to write the video script and make the
              recipes. “Why such a short period of time?” you might ask. Well,
              because my boss did not bother to inform me earlier. I did what
              was needed and earned money for the shooting. It was my first time
              of making professional video, with the makeup and on professional
              fancy kitchen. I was shaking, but I did everything pretty well,
              because I knew my business. I had lots of work to do on the main
              job and I had to do more stuff for those 30% from the video
              course. The company did nothing and got 70%. In a while of running
              and been tired I asked for 40% and rise in the salary on the
              production because the boss hired the girl who knew nothing of raw
              production or desserts for a higher salary. I did not hire the
              girl, because the team did not like it. So I asked the boss to do
              the job of a chef and top manager. In the weekends I was giving
              psychological consultations and trying to build my own project
              with production with 2 girls from the previous job. So I was
              extremely busy. Plus I had to look after Alyosha’s dog. At the end
              of the month I could not find a renter, so I called Alyosha asking
              if he was going to send any money as he promised and what he is
              going to do with his dog. He said: “Well, I have no money. So I
              won’t send you anything. I’ll come soon with my dad on a car to
              grab my dog and stuff”. And that was it. Thank was a big luck with
              the video course because I had just enough money to pay for the
              apartment and food for the next month.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was working for the production, for the backing school,
              supporting my video course and gave psychological consultations.
              It was an intense time. In March my buddy Myron called. We worked
              together in the café and I rented a room from him once. He said
              that his friend is in the city and I invited them for tea. I was
              glad to see Myron and his friend Ramon. I saw Ramon in 2015 right
              after my divorce, and I liked him, but I was not ready for any
              relationships. I rented out the room to a nice girl and Ramon was
              looking for a room. I felt I want to be near this man. We agreed
              that he will rent a room in my apartment and I have to tell this
              to the girl. We went for some dates with Ramon and moved in my
              room. The apartment was quite far from the metro and Ramon wanted
              to find another one near his job. We found a small apartment and
              Ramon wanted to move there at once. I called the landlord asking
              if we can move out earlier than a month and can I get the deposit
              money back. She agreed to everything. She lived in another city,
              and I was going to find new people and show the apartment. During
              the time I lived in it, I changed the floor in the apartment, put
              wallpaper in the kitchen, corridor and toilet. So the flat was
              improved by me a lot. One evening I could not show the flat to new
              people and the landlord asked if I can give the keys to her
              friends. I agreed. How silly I was. There was some of my stuff in
              the flat still. I did not hear anything from the landlord for two
              days after that, so I called her. She said that people moved in
              the flat already. I asked about my stuff and the money. She said
              the contract says I had to warn her one-month prior, and our phone
              talk proves nothing. The contract was left in the flat. Then I
              asked about the keys, she did not realize that I had the second
              pair of keys. She tried to make me come to the metro and give her
              keys, promising that she will send me some money later. I did not
              give her the keys. I just cried sitting in the washroom. 35
              thousand were gone. It was half of my salary doing 2 jobs. The
              landlord was crying too, saying: “my parents are ill, so I need
              money”. I did not go the flat to grab the contract, although I had
              the right to stay in the flat for a month at list. I did want to
              go along the road of doing harm to anyone. I stayed at home and
              cried. It felt so unfair. And I had only one question in my head,
              which was: “why?why this happening to me”. This is a pretty
              existential thing. Why do bad things happen to us? Is this a
              payment for something we have done before? Who decides why, when,
              and who we will pay this debt? And when did we create this debt?
              The word Karma is pretty popular now. Everything bad can be
              explained by it. If something bad happens to you this means you
              did something wrong. So you kind of deserve to get this bad
              anything. It is very hard to admit such a thing. Especially when
              you don’t know anything. It is hard to agree to bad things. I
              thought: “I don’t deserve this. I deserve good things”. At the
              same time it is not clear if we’ve done something bad to the
              person who harms us, or it is random.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ramon never paid attention to my feelings. We did not really talk.
              We were living like comfortable neighbours sharing our meals, a
              flat and a bad. From the very beginning he kept saying: “You
              should not attach to me, this can happen any second”. I was asking
              myself why is he with me, why do we live together, what does he
              feel. He never answered. He never helped around the house and may
              be cooked once or twice in a year when I was ill. During the year
              living together I pushed myself deep inside. I stopped asking
              questions, stopped trying to talk with him and stopped sharing my
              thoughts, because he always made fun of them with his friends. I
              stopped listening to people and started to meditate a lot, because
              any problem or conflict was arising we never talked we meditated
              and that was the end of it. Autumn came and I decided to leave my
              jobs. Ramon earned enough for both of us. He never said that I
              should leave my jobs. I was doing everything around the house,
              cooking and working on 2 jobs. That was too much for me. Ramon
              pushed an idea to become a programmer in me, saying how great this
              is. He said this can provide me money and I can travel and work
              online. I wanted to travel, wanted to leave Moscow, wanted to earn
              money without working like a horse.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I left the job, the company took my video course project.
              Remember my naive nature. I never got the contract, so when I left
              the production, they took the video course. I shared my password
              with a girl in the production. I taught her everything, and she
              agreed to look after the video course, so she’ll get my
              percentage. After leaving, I also learned that my team was talking
              bad behind my back.
            </p>
            <p>
              I tried to study programming when I had my jobs, but I was
              exhausted most time, so I left the jobs to study more. Ramon was
              supporting me financially but never helped with the studying even
              though he was working as a programmer.
            </p>
            <p>
              Winter passed and spring came again. I found the company who was
              ready to take me without much knowledge. And it should be a
              one-year contract. I was excited. But Ramon decided to go on
              travelling. He decided to go to Crimea for the summer and in
              October go to India. He said I can choose what I want. And it was
              clear he will not wait for me or stay one more year for me to get
              the job. I decided to go with him.
            </p>
            <p>
              Crimea was very nice. We met some people, lived by the sea in the
              tent, moved a lot. We came back to Moscow for a month to get the
              visas done, and I spent that month in Vipassana meditation centre
              serving. I served a lot at the centre, when I left my jobs. In
              October everything was ready for our trip. I felt I’m leaving
              Moscow for 3 years. I felt like I met everyone whom I was supposed
              to meet, consult and help, and this is the end of Moscow.
              Everything was done and I was ready to leave. I met all my close
              friends, huge them, said goodbye, knowing that I will not see them
              for a long time.
