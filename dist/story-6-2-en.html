              While I was working with the holotropic breathing and other
              techniques, I conducted mask therapy groups sometimes as well.
              Once I conducted a group at the psychological festival in the
              university gathering. My participants liked it so much that the
              most popular psychologists heard my name and were interested to
              contact and take me in their student groups. There was one man in
              particular, a psychiatrist whom I visited once. My psychiatrist
              friend and then boyfriend was always smoking weed and earned
              nothing as well as giving no help around the house, so this caused
              conflicts, and he finally brought me to that man, his teacher. The
              psychiatrist told me that I’m fully wrong in everything,
              criticized and humiliated me. At the end of the meeting he gave me
              a list with the pills which I should buy and use. I left his
              office feeling horrible. I did not buy the pills and never came
              back to him. And here we go, after my workshop in psychological
              gathering he wanted me to become his student. Of course, he did
              not remember me. But I did. So I refused his invitation and said I
              already have a master.
            </p>
            <p>
              At that gathering I met lots of psychologists working in different
              fields. In the process of working with Vladislav (the master of
              holotropic breathing) it was clear this path does not resolve the
              inside problems. I kept searching for a way. My friend Denis was a
              psychologist who investigated NLP(neurolinguistic programming)
              methods. We were gathering in the university in a small group of
              people trying them and sharing the ideas and effects. Denis
              introduced me to Nikolai and warned me that he is dangerous. But
              Nikolai was so smart and interesting that we got close really
              fast. He came to my flat very often, and we started organizing
              parties and gatherings at my home. He invited me to banya with
              some of his friends. After some time I invited my friends (girls)
              to our meetings, so the company became bigger and funnier. It was
              a private banya, clean and nice. So we set in a small hot room,
              then took a cold bucket shower and set having tea and talking in a
              big living room with a fireplace. Every time Nikolai was giving a
              good warming up in the hot room with wet brooms. After this hit we
              ran outside and stand in the snow. It was a winter hobby. This is
              such a special feeling when you stand in the street in -20ºC on
              the snow in your bathing suit and the steam comes out of your
              body, and you look like a candle. It was such a pleasure.
            </p>
            <p>
              At that time I just left my alcoholic boyfriend after once he
              tried to strangle me at a party because I told him that he is
              drunk, and he should slow down. So Nikolai brought a new nice wave
              in my life. I was working at a jeans shop with nice girls and
              Nikolai sometimes met me after work. He was the one who told me
              that my pain in the stomach and throw up feeling are connected
              with eating meet. I did not believe him but started observing
              myself and noticed that actually those symptoms were quite weak,
              because I was having only sausages from time to time as I was in a
              tight situation with money. I did not earn much from the work, but
              it was a better place than before. Before I was a merchandiser,
              running all over the city. I had not much money, so most time I
              was walking. I did not have enough money for winter clothes and
              shoes, so I was wearing thick snickers and a spring jacket. Fast
              walks helped to stay warm. I was a good worker, but the bosses
              were jerks and I left after 3 months. The owner of the jean shop
              did not want to take me because this was not a good job for me and
              I could do better than that as she said. But I liked the girls and
              warm showroom, so I said give it to me now please, and I will
              leave when I find something better. She gave me the job. Our shop
              was near a shoe shop with arrogant girls and an electronics shop
              with nice hilarious boys. I got along with one unusual guy. He was
              super serious but funny and interesting. I don’t know how, but I
              shared my experience with creatures, and it seemed he fully
              understood me. Then he said I’ll show you something. And he gave
              me his keys. He said “Leave them in the room you sleep.” I did as
              was said, and that night I woke up and saw him standing in the
              corner of my room with a big creature in a shape of some big
              animal on a chain. He was holding it tight, and he showed me that
              he is a part of a group. Each member had a creature. They were
              some kind of fighters or hunters. But each of them was holding the
              creature on the chain and I found it inhumane and cruel. I have
              never done this to my pet. He was fully free and came any time I
              called him. I felt a warm feeling for him and could not imagine
              doing anything like this to him as well as join that group. Next
              morning I took the guy’s keys and gave them back saying that I’m
              not going to join them and this is cruel to hold the creature on a
              chain. After this we communicated less, and he left the shop soon.

              Nikolai was smoking weed quite often. I did not really like pot
              because my first experience with it showed me clearly that I was
              losing the connection with myself. When I smoked, I felt foggy and
              my sensations and feelings were not sharp and important anymore. I
              could not see and feel the world as good, so I did not like it. I
              smoked at the university a couple of times, but this was it. I
              never liked the paranoia I got with weed, that everyone knew I
              smoked, and I definitely did not like the detachment with the
              world and myself. But our evenings with Nikolai were smooth, calm
              and very interesting, so I did not mind his smoking. We shared our
              psychological ideas, experience and discussed different paths in
              it.

              It was autumn when Kolya offered to try magic mushrooms. He
              gathered them carefully for me. He took me and my friend Denis
              into the forest. They made a fire and Kolya said that I should
              take my portion, hold it in my hands and tell them who I am and
              what I want. He said it was an American Indians way to treat them.
              I remembered how Don Huan was always very respectful to all the
              plants. I was respectful and ask them to help me to resolve inside
              stuff. At the same time Kolya gave me a small pipe with weed to
              make sure I will not get a bad trip. I set on a piece of tree by
              the fire and observed carefully what was happening inside. I felt
              the wave of changing. I saw the plants and forest breathing and
              shining with colorful lines. Forest was beautiful. Everything was
              breathing with life. Then Kolya set by my side and we started
              talking. I saw how thoughts appear in my head, how they come out
              in words and how big is the context which stays inside behind the
              words. It was surprisingly incredible how much is not pronounced
              but the person understands. How much I can see without words, just
              by the movement of his body, the movement in his yes and in his
              voice. It was fascinating. At first, I had difficulties with
              operating my body. I could not understand the distance and time. I
              was so connected with everything that it was hard to distinguish
              when something finishes and something else start. Everything was
              in contact with one another. And I was a part of that constant
              movement. Also, I noticed the voice of the mushrooms in the trip.
              There was some information coming from them, it was something
              arising not from me. Like the information that they are all
              connected as a huge web all over the planet. We had lots of trips
              with Nikolai, and I learned a lot. The first great thing I got
              from mushrooms was that my idea I can not stop smoking was not
              true. They always showed my illusions and wrong beliefs. They
              provided clear understanding and answers. Every time I came to
              them with lots of questions. I was looking for answers with them.
              I was practicing all autumn and spring. In summer, we were invited
              to conduct some groups on a psychological festival in the forest
              for a week. It was the first time I lived in a tent. I went
              through lots of different workshops. The most memorable was a
              mystery of being born. The guy, who conducted this group, caught
              me on my way to the other part of our camp. He said choose your
              mother and get in this tube made of people like a channel. I chose
              a super friendly man, who was in my mask therapy group. I went
              down and started to crawl in the channel. People were breathing
              deep, and I felt like I’m really going out of my mothers belly. I
              felt myself like a soldier, strong and disciplined, ready to work
              hard. I saw the light in the end and crawled fast out. The guy I
              chose met me at the exit. I felt him like mother and father in
              one. He hugged me and carried under the tree aside. I set on his
              hips in a hug for a long while. After that experience we became
              close friends, and we are in contact still. He is the one of my
              very close and dear friends. After the festival Nikolai started
              conducting groups like family constellations by Hellinger. I had a
              session with a certified psychologist in Smolensk once. We worked
              with my question in a group of 8 or 10 people. I don’t remember
              what the question was. The process was the following: you tell
              your question to the psychologist and then choose each person of
              your family including yourself. You come to the person, put your
              hands on her/his shoulders and say “you are my
              father/brother/lover or whoever. First you chose yourself. Then
              other necessary members. Then all the people should concentrate on
              the inside feelings, sensations or desires and move accordingly.
              For example, if anyone wants to sit, lay down or walk away from
              someone near, they can do so. In some time when everyone finished
              their moving we saw a 3D picture of my family. It was crazy. My
              dad was lying on the floor, I was sitting by his side looking at
              him. My mother was standing not far from us looking at my father.
              My elder brother was sitting feeling like he wanted to lay down
              near our dad. At that time I lived with the strong feeling of
              willing my dad’s hug and my brother was drinking badly. As we know
              he died from it later. When I saw that picture I was shocked, I
              did not overcome my father’s death and still was in sorrow. I knew
              this should be changed. The psychiatrist asked me if it was enough
              willing to finish this work. But I said no. And as soon as I
              realized this should change, this is not right, this is enough.
              The person who was me got up and went away from my dad. That was
              insane, how fast it changed. I felt like a bag with stones fell
              off me. I felt so light and free after this session. I realized
              this method is helpful. The 3D model which is in our unconscious
              mind affect our life and emotional part. This observation from the
              side helps to see what is actually happening. After this group I
              was at many similar groups conducted by my friend Nikolai. Every
              time the chosen people felt the feelings of original people. For
              example people, who saw each other for the first time, could feel
              strong love or hatred according to the real relations of those,
              who they were at that moment. This effect of being able to connect
              to someone else and feel the way they do is called the substitute
              perception effect. During the groups I saw aborted children
              seeking for a revenge for their mother, which caused pain or
              destruction in the feet or spine going together with mother’s
              feeling of gilt, people halfway to the grave, mother’s giving
              their responsibilities to their children. We did sessions for me
              too sometimes, and it was always useful. At that time my elder
              brother was sent to my city, and I was kind of responsible for
              him. It was hard for me. Once I was carrying him at night from the
              bar to my flat. He woke up and tried to come into my room, but I
              locked it. He was asking me to open the door. I was in panic and
              very scared. I was with my boyfriend, but he was trying to talk.
              Finally, I called the police, and they took my brother away. After
              that I never allowed him to stay at my place. At the session I saw
              how my mother gave me the responsibility for the brother. I gave
              it back right there and vualya! Shortly my mother made a decision
              to take my brother back to her city. She came to Smolensk and
              after 2 weeks he left with her. That was a relief.
            </p>
            <p>
              I learned a lot about family systems, what can happen. I saw lots
              of different variants of switched roles. The most fascinating for
              me was that the aborted children almost always wanted to be
              remembered in the family line.
            </p>
            <p>
              That summer was the first time Nikolai invited me to a
              chillout-trance party in a forest. I agreed. The festival was for
              1-2 thousand people. It was like a nice camp with lots of music,
              some cafés, banya conducted by my friends and shops with cool
              clothes and hand made stuff. One morning Nikolai gave me a small
              stamp. He said this is LSD. You should try it. It is similar to
              magic mushrooms, but there are differences. I took it. There were
              lots of people as you remember. They all were adults, but when I
              came out from our small camp into the field I saw kids. Unhappy,
              sad, miserable kids. They were smoking, drinking, having drugs.
              They were playing adults but inside the real them were kids. It
              was so clear. I also observed myself and worked with my stuff
              inside as usual. I was asking questions, looking in the answers,
              exploring my belief system and behavior patterns.
            </p>
            <p>
              I had lots of trips with Nikolai and some of my friends at the
              parties like that one and just in a forest. Nikolai always drove
              us somewhere and back to my home. It was a time of big observation
              and exploring. I met lots of people.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the end of one spring festival I realized that Smolensk is done
              for me. There was no place to grow. I was changing jobs and
              consulting people and Kolya saw a brilliant psychologist in me.
              But I could not earn enough for living, because people did not
              understand that those talks are actual help and work. And i have
              needs and money to live.
