              I was good at creating art and drawing. I could sit busy for hours
              and I loved it. My mother did a superb job providing the best
              materials she can buy for me. One year my teachers decided to put
              me in the competition, so I was working hard for a full year
              getting all different kinds of art ready. When all works were
              ready the teachers were satisfied. But one day I came into a
              drawing school classroom and found all my works in a dirty corner
              not needed. The teachers made a decision to send their daughter’s
              works instead. It was clear enough that the quality of work did
              not play any role in this completion between me and her.
            </p>
            <p>
              This situation was a big hit for me. The school was my favourite
              place to come. Sometimes I got words of praise, quite often the
              teacher was reading a book to us, and it was a calm place where I
              can create something and share my point of view. I was so
              carefully working hard at every piece for that big competition and
              then I found it was not needed and stored in a dirty corner. I
              left the school and never came back. My mother did not work hard
              on figuring out what happened. I loved the place so much and then
              one day said “I’m not going there again.” Sounds pretty unusual.
              Don’t you think?
            </p>
            <p>
              That might seems like a small thing but for some reason that shut
              my desire to draw totally even nowadays. That was the first time
              my creation was denied.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I was 14 I wanted to go to a dance school. I was serious
              enough to go to live in another city with my friend to attend a
              dance collage, but my mother said: “No”. Check my mom’s rule
              number three. In short, you do what she says without asking or
              complaining. And what can you really do without monetary support?
              A couple of years later I was dancing with a guy at a house party.
              We were both drunk, and he decided to make a twist, and we made it
              except my right knee. It was not in good time, so I tore something
              in my knee, got caught into a cast for two months and never get
              recovered from it. So if I go now in almost any dancing class I
              will walk out in ten minutes laming. Yoga is the only space where
              I don’t feel like a cripple. I have great flexibility, so I feel
              at home with it. The dancing door was closed forever.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the university I loved dancing and clubs, so I dreamed to be a
              DJ. I learned how to create music on the computer in Fl Studio and
              started to create my own drum’n’bass tracks. I went to a DJ school
              and I heard everything right and did a great job, that was so much
              fun. But my best friend Veronica came there with me. And
              unfortunately she was really weak on this. We both graduated, and
              I was invited to work in our favorite club with my favorite DJ who
              promised to help me with everything. That was all I dreamed about,
              but Veronica said if I will accept it she will stop communicating
              with me. I was stupid enough to refuse this opportunity, and she
              stopped communicating with me anyways after less than a month. She
              just left the university group we were in to another one and never
              talked to me again. That jealousy did not allow her to stay by my
              side.
            </p>
            <p>
              I lost my previous best friend quite the same way. We got in a
              company and one guy was flirting with her, which was pretty
              unusual. I made my boyfriend to tell me the truth why this guy is
              doing it, because she was far from a good-looking girl. He said
              that the guy was going to push her to have sex, and then he would
              immediately leave her. I told my friend everything I learned, but
              she said “I’m jealous of her success” and I did not call her the
              next day so did not she. Nastya was my best friend since I was 8
              or 9. There was a company of girls in our apartment building and
              suddenly one of the girls told the others some lies about me. So
              everyone stopped communicating with me except Nastya. My mom
              figured out that somehow, because I never snitched, and made the
              girl to resolve this issue.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nastya was the one who made me smoking when I was 14 even against
              the promise to my mother. When I was in a second grade two girls
              stole money from their mother’s wallets and bought the whole class
              sweets and chips. They got caught and everyone in a class was
              obliged to make a promise to a parent. So my promise was “I will
              never smoke”. Everyone knew about it, so if anyone suggested me a
              cigarettе, it was good enough to tell about the promise. Anyways,
              when I was 14, Nastya said one day: “try to smoke with me, or I
              will stop communicating with you”. As a stupid friend I agreed to
              try it and broke my promise. After that I was smoking for 10
              years. I was spending my money for food at school on cigarettes
              and stayed hungry till I got home.
            </p>
            <p>
              The 10-year smoking thing finally got resolution in one of my
              mushroom’s trips. I was the one who did not like to depend on
              anything, so I was always attentive not to get addicted to
              anything. But the cigarettes and some spiritual connection with
              them was so strong. I fully believed I could not stop it. But
              mushrooms showed me that this was not true. I was in a forest with
              my friends. I was sitting on a tree and suddenly realized: ”I am
              in a trip for 6 hours and I have not had a single cigarette!” That
              was an amazing discovery. Next day I was walking in the street and
              lit a cigarette as I often did and a huge wave of shame covered
              me. “What am I doing poisoning myself and others? Harming myself
              and others”. I threw the cigarette away and started researching
              how to stop smoking. I asked my friends and a girl recommended me
              a book “Easy way to stop smoking” by Allen Carr. It took me two
              days to finish it. It was a boring repetition of the same idea and
              my friend told me: “Remember! The key thing from it is a final
              decision. You should make a final decision to stop”. I don’t
              really know if Allen is writing about it in his book. But I
              stopped smoking right when I finished reading the book. So it was
              unexpectedly easy. Ten years of smoking, two days of reading and a
              final decision. I stopped smoking and never started again.
