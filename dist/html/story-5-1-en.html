              I remember spring of 2003. It was the time when half of my
              classmates, including me, passed the entering exams for University
              in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk. Everything was simple and clear. I am going
              into the University with almost all my friends. That was so great.
              We celebrated and started getting ready for the graduation high
              school exams. I was bad at spelling in Russian language but very
              good at literature, so we made a deal with the teacher of those
              two subjects that if I write my last exam for a good mark she will
              put it for Russian language in my school diploma. But it turned
              surprisingly different. The teacher put a good mark for Russian
              language and literature as well. My class teacher tried to talk to
              her, because it did not make any sense as I had an excellent mark
              for literature every year. You might think that I was reading a
              lot, but that was not like it. Every year I was buying a book with
              summaries of all books we were going through. So just before the
              class I read the summary and when I spoke I made an image of deep
              understanding of the book. As you already know I’ve got that
              characteristic of giving a wonderful speech. So the teacher
              disagreed to go according to the deal and left good marks for both
              subjects. It was so weird for me. Why would you do this to a kid
              at the graduation? Does this really mean so much to throw this
              stone at the end. In spite of this I still had a good mood because
              we were preparing the last party for all the teachers and parents.
              We worked a lot on our last dance and decided to sing a song for
              our class teacher. There was no-one willing to sing. So the choice
              fell on me and another girl. We were not good at it but agreed and
              did our best to sound fine. That was the firs and the last of my
              singing on the stage. On last night we reached the bottom of the
              teacher’s heart with that song. Two days before our party my
              mother said that I am going to Smolensk, a city on the opposite
              end of Russia, on the morning flight right after the party. My
              world cracked. All I knew was going to pass away, and I had to go
              to another city and I have two months to enter the university. I
              did not know what will happen if I won’t. And I could not really
              think about it. I was going to another city to live alone. I was
              16. The news were so shocking that I felt paralyzed and had
              nothing to say. I could not enjoy the party knowing that I’m going
              to fly away tomorrow. Why would you buy tickets right after the
              party? No time was given to say goodbye to my life and friends.

              This action of my mom led me to hysteria with every move in my long travelling which started in 2018. Every single move generated so much tension and fear that I could hardly gather my stuff. I became very upset and angry at the same time. I recognized this connection only in 2021. The feeling of being kicked out of the house made me feel no more needed and a burden. My elder brother died from alcoholism partially because of the same feeling. The First factor was the feeling of being not loved by my father and then being kicked out from his home when he was around 16. So as we see my mother threw the first two children out of her house with a new family. This fact also gave me a strong feeling of being betrayed and traded for a man. That man did not really help with earning money or taking care of the house. He abused all of us and behaved as a pig. He was drinking every evening but fortunately after a bottle of vodka he always went to sleep. In these relations of my mother I can see her most powerful fear of being alone without a man. And as we say to have no-one to bring you a glass of water in the moment of death coming. So she stayed with that man no matter how bad everything went. I did not realize why my elder brother felt so bad for a long time. The story of our past was gathering slowly like a puzzle. I collected all the peaces recently. He died in 2018. And when I realized it all in 2019 he came into my dream and I told him that I was in the same situation and I understand him now. It gave a relief. 
            </p>
            <p>Now let’s get back to Smolensk in 2003.</p>
            <p>
              We came to Smolensk with my mother. Her mother and sister were
              living there, so I was supposed to be there under their attention.
              My mother rented me a room with shared bathroom and toilet.
              Kitchen was also shared for a corridor with 8 rooms. I got a
              kettle, table, wardrobe and working table with a chair. She said:
              “No TV set. You are here to study”. I begged her to buy me a
              cassette player because it was the most important thing in my
              life. I had one before and it helped to survive. Music was the
              thing I loved. It supported me in hard times and made me feel not
              alone having that. My birthday is in September, so I played my
              last hope saying this would be a present for my birthday. She
              agreed and bought me a small boombox and some Cd’s. I had never
              seen a CD before.
            </p>
            <p>
              My mother spent time with her sister and mother while I was trying
              to understand what should I chose, so I definitely pass the
              entering exams in the university. My mother’s dream was that I
              become a translator because I was good at languages. I studied
              English and German at school and was good at it because I had
              excellent teachers. I was also good at math. Math teacher was the
              only one who liked me and helped. So I was thinking to become a
              math teacher. My fear not to enter the university and get into
              unknown future was so strong, so I decided to try to go through
              English exam. But there was a Russian dictation exam too. That was
              definitely super hard for me. I passed exams for two universities
              and because of poor spelling got in only on paid basis. I chose
              the non-governmental nice university. So at the end of July the
              decision was made. I’m going to study in Smolensk Humanitarian
              University.
            </p>
            <p>
              I still was in shock that my mother threw me out of the house. It
              was painful. I felt that she was doing everything to her new
              husband: gave my home, cooked the way he liked, took a great care
              of their child. I was an outsider in the family and then thrown
              out as not needed thing. Of course, you might say: “She paid for a
              room, education and provided money for food and clothes during the
              studying period”. But I mean the emotional layer. Money can not
              give you human warmth or feeling of being loved.
            </p>
            <p>
              I made my mind that I don’t need her anymore, and did not write or
              answer any letters. I decided to try to be better, then I was
              before and study really hard. During the day I worked hard in
              classes and wrote poems at night. Poems were as sad as the music I
              was listening to. I was smoking a lot and slept not much. But my
              dream of been a good student and learn English perfectly was not
              going to come true. The teacher of English grammar made her mind
              to get money from me, so does not matter how hard I worked I got a
              bad mark. I worked so hard that at one point I knew the whole book
              by heart. My classmates could tell me the page and I started to
              tell the exact text they see in the book. If in my work were the
              same sentences from the book the teacher would consider them
              wrong. My mother did not believe me and she asked her sister to go
              to the teacher and figure out what’s going on. My ant was a fine
              lady, and she understood that the teacher wants money and will not
              give up on this. Mother was ready to pay, but I said “No. I am not
              going to pay.” I worked even harder for 2 years, getting bad marks
              on that subject all the time. My student group were the witness of
              this. I believed I could go through it. The last exam for that
              discipline came, and I answered all my questions, three questions
              for excellent students, five questions for bad students perfectly.
              The whole group was totally impressed. They knew this is an
              excellent passing. The teacher said it will take her two weeks to
              make a decision. She was taking this exam with another teacher. I
              passed all other exams and then time to find out the mark came.
              They gave me a satisfactory mark. I was shocked. They said: “You
              know, we are allowed to give a certain amount for excellent and
              good marks, and we made our mind who will get those. So you are
              getting satisfactory”. That was like an earthquake for me. This is
              how the system works. If you don’t have money, and you are unknown
              in the city your hard work makes no difference. It does not matter
              what you do, you will get what is left. I cried in the toilet for
              some time and made a decision to stop studying hard. I made a deal
              with excellent students and copied all the works. So I started to
              get good marks with this copying. I had one rule: no matter what I
              attend all the classes and work active if the class implies this.
              And I definitely lost my interest and desire to stay at this
              faculty.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the same time my friend Veronica noticed that I was perfect at
              understanding people and always knew what to ask and say. She said
              I should go to psychological faculty. And this felt so right.
