              Most of my life I felt like an alien in a human society. Being 8 I
              remembered living in a different place. My family and I were tall
              big shiny creatures. We communicated telepathically. The
              connection between us and the whole place felt so warm, light and
              happy. I felt loved, accepted, open and relaxed. I called the
              place I remembered Green planet. I don’t know why a planet. That
              place felt so far away, and I missed it a lot. Human life, in the
              place I was in, felt like hell. This arose questions in me : “Why
              am I here? Why is everything so bad? What did I do, so I deserved
              this horrible everything? Why do I feel and understand the world
              differently?
            </p>
            <p>
              I was a very sensitive being. When I was 9 or 10 I saw a spirit in
              a shape of a big white dog in my room. I asked who he was, and he
              said he is my protector. Before that it I remember myself being a
              small girl spending days, sitting under the table alone in the
              flat. I sat under the table because I was scared of what I saw and
              felt around. I felt the movement of the creatures, who live with
              us on a bit different level. I did not understand what this was.
              If I tried to share this with my mother to get some explanation,
              she never answered or believed. She never wanted to figure
              anything out or understand. Actually she kind of hated this part
              of me. She did not want to hear such things, she did not want to
              see this part of me. She always wanted me to be normal, to be the
              same as others. She tried to get this off me, saying this is
              bullshit, this is not real, this does not exist. But I could not
              agree, because I saw and felt it, and I trusted myself. Sometimes
              I felt like I’m crazy. There was no-one around, who can understand
              such things or feel the same way. I was totally alone, trying to
              figure something out.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the age of 18 I met a psychiatrist at a party in a club. He
              told me about Carlos Castaneda books. He lent me a book the next
              day. And that was exactly what I was looking for. I always felt a
              deep connection with American Indians. I found someone who can see
              and feel the same way. Don Huan was my teacher at that time. I
              felt such a relief. I am not crazy, the level I see does exist. I
              bought all his books and read it all the time. A book was with me
              everywhere. I read a lot on lecture classes. I practiced
              everything what Don Huan tough Carlos. I used no drugs. I was
              working hard at every step in the normal state of the mind and
              everything worked for me. I saw all types of creatures who live
              near people. That time was the scariest time in my life. I was
              open for this type of communication, and they saw it. In a city I
              was like a firework, so the creatures kept coming in my room. At
              nighttime, I say black shadow figures standing in the room. The
              room was crowded, and I could not get read of them. I could not
              sleep. That psychiatrist, who showed me this teaching, became my
              friend, and quite often came to stay for a night to help me to
              sleep and rest. At those times I also had strong pain in the
              middle of my belly. I saw the world shining and being like a huge
              web, where everything is connected. People were yellow-white
              shining and warm vessels. Creatures, I was exploring, were blue
              and cold. It became clear just that they don’t really have a
              certain shape, they turn into any shape our mind can see and
              understand.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also learned that they eat our energy. The creatures I met were
              eating low vibration emotions like anger, sadness, suffering,
              excitement. I saw gambling houses full of those, as well as
              monuments under which many people, who were killed in the war,
              were buried. I saw small creatures and medium size ones. Small
              ones live in corners by the ceiling in a tribe. They attack all
              together. By attack, I mean their connection to you and sucking
              your energy. Medium ones are mostly on their own. They can come in
              groups, but they work each for itself also sucking from so-called
              “bad” emotions. Both of those types can not be considered as bad,
              because it is the way they are and the way they survive.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was brave enough to face them, so I did not turn into their
              energy food. Reading Castaneda’s books I realized I want to catch
              a creature. To catch a creature means literary somehow catch it,
              and it will serve you the way you want. I learned 3 state in our
              sleep process. First you are sleepy but kind of still awake, then
              you go into the state between awake and asleep, and the asleep
              state. As well, I started a practice of lucid dreaming.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the same time I got brave enough to tell my mother that I don’t
              want to study languages and I want to go to psychological faculty.
              She did not agree. And power was in her hands, because I was
              totally financially dependent. So she decided I stay in the
              translation faculty and study psychology in the evening. And the
              main thing: I must graduate from psychological faculty with an
              excellent red musters degree. I agreed.
            </p>
            <p>
              So all those practices with creatures were going with the whole
              day of studying two totally different things and dancing in a club
              every second week. “How could you do this?” you might ask. Well.
              That personal practice was my real life. The time when I am who I
              really am. So it was a priority.
            </p>
            <p>
              I had a problem with my lucid dreaming practice. In the book the
              task was to find your hands and look at them. They will be the
              only moving and kind of living thing. I could not do it. But I
              again was very fortunate. I had a discipline in my university
              called “the changed states of mind” where a nice teacher told us
              lots about psychedelics, drugs, holotropic breathing, Castaneda’s
              practices and lucid dreams. Right after the first lecture I came
              to him and told the problem with the task. He recommended finding
              a book and reading it. The same night I tried and nailed it! I
              could not read it. The letters started to move and fade. So I
              understood this is a dream. Later practice also let me to find
              hands, create my own scenes and different stuff. Once I even was
              practicing my speech on the stage which I had to give in a speech
              competition. So I was working hard during the day as well as in
              dreams at night.
            </p>
            <p>
              I tried astral travelling as well. But the realization that I will
              try to live the body and never come back was so strong that I left
              this practice immediately.
            </p>
            <p>So let’s get back to the creatures.</p>
            <p>
              I made my mind to catch one. I learned how to get in this between
              awake and asleep state pretty fast. In this state I could see the
              creatures and interact. This state was very scary. In this state
              you always find yourself in the room the physical body is. Quite
              often the room was dark, and I could not switch on the light. So a
              goal number one was to take this under control. I did not know how
              to catch the creature, but I should be able to get out of this
              state, when I need. So my psychiatrist friend helped me. He came
              to my place and I made 20 minutes jumps in that state of sleep. He
              woke me up every 20 minutes observing my body. My goal was to let
              him know from there that I need him to wake me up. I tried to move
              the body and shout, he could not see it. After a couple of tries I
              tried to use my breathing. And bingo he can see my deep slow
              breathing. Then for a couple of weeks or more I was observing this
              state and my dreams to see if there’s someone, who comes
              repeatedly. Finally, I noticed one, who liked me. You might ask
              “liked?”. Yep. He came in the room, and it was always with a good
              light. He was in a shape of a man. He hugged me, kissed me, and
              set with me on the bed. He came in a shape of a man, but the
              person looked differently every time. The main thing was his
              hugging and touching softly and carefully. After a few meetings, I
              realized this is the same being. I decided to catch him. And all
              my tries with waking me up was useless. The creature came randomly
              without any system. So I was just ready to catch it, when he will
              visit me again. I had no idea what exactly I was going to do. The
              first chance came. We were sitting on my bed as usual, and when he
              came closer I hugged him and tried to hold. He was scared and
              disappeared immediately. Next time I tried to hold his hands and
              he ran away again. Third time I was again in a room full of light.
              It was nighttime. I opened the window to have a cigarette and saw
              him hanging across the window really close. I grabbed him by the
              arms, and he screamed and disappeared. He was mine. We were
              linked. Next night I called him in my normal state, and he came.
              You might ask: “how did I know that he came?”. When a creature of
              this size come close to a sensitive person the great fear arises.
              You can not say why or what you are scared of, but the desire to
              run away to the end of this world is huge. I observed my
              sensations and feelings to him and despite that huge fear I felt
              like I got a dog, who understands me. I felt warmth and connection
              with him. We went along with an image of an enormous dog. I want
              to pay your attention again to the point, that in reality those
              creatures do not have any shape, they just cold, blue substances.
            </p>
            <p>
              I learned that my guy eats negative emotions, and if I ask him to
              do something I provide the food. What can you ask from such a
              thing? Well, first thing I asked to protect my home from others.
              So not a creature except him can enter it. He did a good job. He
              stayed near the room at night and I started to sleep well.
              Providing him with my fear before going to bed. Then I called him
              siting at the lecture. I asked him to scare the teacher. The
              teacher’s voice became thin and scratchy followed by a cough. The
              cough was getting stronger as the creature was coming closer to
              her. Finally, she left the classroom. The lecture was over. I was
              amazed. I understood that was not right, but the interest won.
              Sometimes I called him, when I walked home late to accompany me.
              Ones I was followed by a man. I noticed it fast and called my pet.
              I saw a huge cape showed up behind my back, the following man
              immediately turn to another way. Another night a company followed
              me, and they were thinking to get to me. As soon as the pet showed
              up the group disappeared. I loved walking, so I spent many nights
              walking alone from the downtown to the not safe area, where I
              lived. My friends were always asking: “aren’t you scared to walk
              that way alone this late?” I was not scared anymore. The creature
              was by my side. I took 2-hour walks at any time in any condition,
              and I was always safe.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ones I was hanging out with a biker’s club. My friend Tanya told
              me their problem with the man she loved. She said that a couple of
              weeks ago they were at a party, and a girl saw them. She wanted to
              get Tanya’s boyfriend and says she’ll get him! Very soon after
              that, they were not able to sleep together. When he came close to
              Tanya, he was getting so hot that he could not stay near, so he
              started slipping on the flow. Tanya felt there’s something wrong
              and strange with this. Same night I called my guy. I asked him to
              find who harms my friend and stop it. I went to bed and in the
              middle of the night I woke up, sat and started seeing with my eyes
              what he sees. I saw a dark room with a candle. The old lady, a
              witch, who did dark magic for others was sitting in the corner of
              her bed. She saw him. She was scared shitless. She started
              screaming, begging not to touch her. She promised to stop this bad
              deal and stop such activity at all. The pet came closer. And the
              vision finished. I did not see anything else. So I don’t really
              know how this ended for the lady. He showed what was needed to
              understand that the task was fulfilled.
