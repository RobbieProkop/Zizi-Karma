              I was born in the middle of Sakhalin Island in a tiny city in
              1986. If you’re imaging Russia with Moscow as a face, Sakhalin
              Island would be a little toe of the right foot near Japan. The
              Island was a prison for a time, so it turned into not
              well-mannered, rough, straightforward society. You might say:
              “come on! All Russians are quite straightforward and rough”, which
              is true, but the society I’m talking about has also come in a
              wrapper of street rules and gang/mafia watching people following
              them.
            </p>

            <p>
              When I was born, I shocked my mother and physicians with a body
              fully covered with long black hair which fell off after 3 days. I
              went against my mother’s expectations of being a boy, but my
              father was pretty happy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before the age of 3, I remember some episodes but they are more
              like light flashes with a taste of being abandoned, not accepted,
              and scared. Leaving the child with an unknown(for the child)
              relative in some city for long time, parent’s verbal and physical
              fights, beating can easily bring a child to such feelings which is
              easy to understand. So let’s keep going.
            </p>
            <p>
              I brought extra work for my mom because I could not have animal
              milk and meat. She did not really understand this, so she kept
              trying to put those in me and had to clean it coming back. This
              drove her nuts which led to shouting, getting mad and beating. She
              was definitely a lady of a very short temper.
            </p>
            <p>
              I got my first surgery between the age of 3 to 4. My appendix was
              removed, and I found myself alone in the hospital asking for a
              warm glass of milk during my mothers visit. I fall asleep right
              after that request and never drank that glass of milk.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was a short, thin child eating only a small amount of food and
              if I was hungry there was nothing better than a piece of black
              bread with a touch of salt. This was quite an unusual love for a
              child. I mean, “how many children did you see who love a piece of
              black bread instead of sweets or chips?”. I looked in this deeper
              after years and I remembered my past life where I died from
              starvation during the war. The city was occupied and locked down,
              no food support was provided. I remembered my happiness being an
              old, very thin lady holding a loaf of mouldy black bread. So this
              is the root of this love and a simple demand to be satisfied.
