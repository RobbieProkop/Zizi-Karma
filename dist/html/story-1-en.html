              It was a sunny spring day. Lots of snow was everywhere around our
              house and my father was sawing wood. I remember seeing his back
              just before I started walking on a sidewalk with a ball. I was
              around 4, I guess. The sidewalk was wooden and lied on the water,
              which was a part of a swamp beside the road. I walked on the
              sidewalk and suddenly my ball fell into the water. I looked down
              and saw a piece of snow going from the sidewalk on the water,
              looking like an extension, which can help to get the ball back.
              Then I looked at my father’s back, made a step on that snow and
              the time slowed down. I fell into the water, luckily grabbed the
              wooden sidewalk with one arm and pulled myself out of that swamp.
              I was fully wet and immediately ran home and hid in the corner
              behind the armchair. I don’t know how much time I spent there, but
              I was so scared of my mother finding me there wet. But I got luck
              and my father found me and changed the clothes.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’m sure you guessed that led to bad relations with the water.
            </p>
            <p>After that first episode I sank 4 more times.</p>
            <p>
              Once in a swimming pool. My mother was teaching me how to swim.
              There were some children with their mothers around. And when I
              start swimming towards my mother she did not pay attention to me
              and I got under the water on the bottom of a pool. I saw her legs
              and I started walking to them, when I touched them I started
              climbing on my mother’s body up to get the air. That was the first
              and the last time learning to swim with her.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another time we were few kids in a deep lake on a pumped truck
              wheel. I slid in the hole in the center. Got luck to be caught by
              the hand of a girl before sank too deep. I remember the sunlight
              coming through the muddy water of the lake and a thought “This is
              it. This is the end of this life.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Once I was washed away from my mother’s back laying on a pool
              float with a wave created by her husband coming on another float.
              Again got luck to be caught by my mother’s hand.
            </p>
            <p>
              And the last: I thought I knew how to swim good enough being
              taught by a friend and I set a challenge to swim through a fast
              wide river. I almost made it to the other side, but got very
              tired, tried to grab a tree branch, but it broke and the river
              almost swallowed me. Got luck by grabbing the river bank with my
              hands and finally got on it.
            </p>
            <p>
              And the last adding to this is a couple of memories of the past
              lives being drowned in a river. It is an agony to be under the
              water by force of hands holding your neck and whole body under the
              water till your last moment.
            </p>
            <p>
              All that brought me to the feeling of insecurity, tension and
              sometimes panic attacks being in the water.
