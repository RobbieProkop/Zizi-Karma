              I started drinking vodka when I was 13. I spent many evenings
              getting drunk and having fun with my classmates. In summer, we sat
              on the benches of different streets. In cold times we set in each
              other rooms or in Tony’s room in the apartment building’s
              basement. As you remember I had to be on time at home, so I got
              drunk, sober up and went home. We did not have much pocket money,
              so we bought a 1,5 liter drinks like vodka + chemical orange
              juice. On the holiday celebrations we all set by the table with
              tea and cakes with our class teacher. There was a tradition that
              the teacher goes and talk on the phone in the other room in the
              next door building of the same school. So she always said: “I’m
              gonna go to make a call.” And that “call” took her hours. At those
              times there were no cell phones, so we paid for stationary phones.
              And this call was paid by the school. As soon as she left the
              room, we started drinking alcohol. We hid empty bottles behind the
              piano, and when the space was full after a couple of celebration
              meetings, we gathered all the bottles in bags, passed the bags
              through the window outside and boys through them in the garbage
              bin by the apartment building next door.
            </p>
            <p>
              My mother used to send me to a summer camp for a month. Once I
              came from the camp, and we decided to celebrate my return with a
              friend. We bought a bottle of vodka. “How?” You might ask,
              understanding properly that I was 14. How can you buy it in the
              store? Well, it was scary. You come into the store, ask for a
              bottle of vodka, the seller ask for whom you are buying it, and
              you simply say for my father. Done. We have drunk half a liter
              with my friend Katerina. We were sitting by the river with two
              guys, but they refused to drink. So we drank it alone. I was so
              drunk that day that I could not remember the whole thing. I
              remember things like flashlights. At some point I discovered
              myself at my apartment building. My neighbor saw me absolutely
              drunk. She was a nice Korean lady, she did not tell anything to my
              mother. I threw up the whole night and fell asleep in the toilet.
              In the morning I said to my mom that I was poisoned. I was quite
              ashamed and confused of not remembering much. After that I made a
              decision to never drink vodka without mixing it with a juice.
            </p>
            <p>
              I drunk for a long time. Sometimes I even came home drunk but
              always got lucky not to be noticed. My mother was often busy.
              Drinking helped me to relax, have fun and forget about real state
              I was in.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was drinking a lot in the university too. Sometimes I went with
              my friends to the top of a 9-story building. It was an amazing
              view of the city there. So we climbed on the tree to get in the
              second store of this empty building. Then we walked 2 stories and
              there was a wooden stick to the 5th floor, so you walk carefully
              on it by the wall and then normal stairs up to the top. We carried
              beer with chips and went down in the darkness drunk. Some girls
              were on hills. Great luck that no-one fell down and broke their
              neck.
            </p>
            <p>
              Alcohol was my close friend. Sometimes I could not relax without a
              bottle of beer. There were times of hard work and studying when
              the inner tension was so intense that nothing helped to let it go
              and rest. I was always wearing a mask of fun, smile and laughs
              outside the room I lived in. I always appeared to be in a good
              mood and joyful. But at home I let the real me out and it was a
              horrible feeling of loneliness and helplessness. I started with
              this mask when I was around 12.
            </p>
            <p>
              As I said before I was a very shy, introverted child, skinny and
              quiet. I loved to observe people, their emotions and reactions.
              Sometimes I was behaving or talking with my friends the way they
              will give me the expected reaction. I played a lot with making
              them feel in a certain way. Sometimes it costed quite a bit. Like
              once, I made a boy angry with me, so he lifted me up and scratched
              my cheek on a house wall. The cheek was bleeding, and I still have
              some scars on it. With those observations and home situation I
              learned pretty fast how to behave to fit into the society. I felt
              people like open books. I met someone, looked in, communicated,
              and kind of learned what is there on the bottom of the person.
              Normally I got board in two weeks. So, during the school I have
              never dated someone more than two weeks. It does not mean I did
              not have romantic first time love relations. Because I did. I was
              8 and he was 10. He lived in a next door apartment building. He
              was tall with nice short blond hair. Zhenya was strong and loved
              me a lot. He always protected me from other boys, and we were a
              couple but never really held hands. For us and everyone we were
              together. That year I got a small book for girls with simple
              prayers. I prayed every evening from the bottom of my childish
              heart asking the God to let me be with Zhenya for a long time. But
              this did not work out, and we lost the connection within a year. I
              have no idea what actually happened.
            </p>
            <p>
              After that I had lots of boyfriends with nothing serious. Boys
              always liked me. Everything was simple and clear with them. I
              think I have never trusted them and never got deep in anyone. I
              never thought about their feelings. When I felt ready to leave
              them I just was busy for an evening, and next day someone might
              call me saying that they saw my boyfriend with another girl, or I
              asked my boyfriend if he wanted to tell me anything and there
              always was something to say about another girl. So I played a lamb
              and like they harmed me while I felt nothing and just was glad to
              be free again. I got my first kiss when I was 11. I kissed with
              boys after that and let some touching going, but intimacy was a
              closed question. Nothing like that before marriage. It’s quite
              funny how it came so. I was 14 and my friend who was 2 years older
              offered to have sex. I agreed in spite of the fact that we were
              not even dating. He was a very handsome guy. We chose the day and
              time, when we both go late to school and there would be no-one at
              my house. I was lucky. That day we had to change our clock one
              hour forward, so the guy was one hour late. And during this hour I
              realized that this step is a 100 % wrong move. When he knocked at
              my door I opened it and said I’m not going to do this, and I left
              to school. I always got respect from a boy or a man. There was
              something in my eyes which attracted them and as they said there’s
              something mystic and incomprehensible in me. They flew to me like
              moths to the light. And every time I broke their wings and went
              away. But all that started after I kissed a boy 2 years older than
              me, I was around 13. We stood in a corridor. I was so shy and
              confused, did not know what to do, the heart was going crazy, and
              I was so glad to see that boy. He kissed me, and after he said:
              “You don’t even know how to kiss”. My face turned all red and I
              rushed home. I sat in the armchair so frightened, lost, and
              shaking. I realized: “I should never show the real me, I should be
              brave no matter what, I should hide myself so no-one can hurt me
              again. We never met or talked with that boy again. I got some boys
              who taught me how to kiss, and I was a good student and learned
              some nice tricks. I developed my mask to the point of showing fun,
              joy, and laughter all the time. Sometimes I was invited to be a
              referee in girls conflicts which happened at parties. Almost
              always I was seriously drunk and could hardly see what was going
              in the dispute, but my decisions were taken as final, and normally
              we gave another chance to the one who was wrong. It was crazy how
              people sometimes relied on my word. For example once I went out
              from a party to get some fresh air and saw a girl surrounded by 6
              or 8 boys. They were going to take her to someone’s home and use
              her. I rushed to my friends, who were a part of a local gang and
              asked them to get the girl out of this. We all went to the girl,
              took her out and made the others leave her alone and never touch
              her again. I was checking that girl for a couple of weeks to make
              sure that they really left her alone, and they did. Another
              example is a sad one. My ex best friend Nastya invited my new best
              friend to an evening meeting behind the House of culture. It was a
              quite dark area, and if anyone invited someone there it meant
              there was going to be a fight. I took 3 more girls with us. Nastya
              came with a girl and they both were wearing sport suits. You don’t
              wear such things for no reason. That was so clear for me that she
              planned to bit my besty, that’s why I came with my other friends.
              At the meeting there were 5 of us and 2 of them. I was doing the
              speech, and we ended that 4 of us make one punch on Nastya’s face.
              It still seems crazy for me: “how can you agree to this? What did
              I say, so we made such an agreement?”. Anyways you can imagine
              what kind of face the girl got after this. I was the one who paid
              the highest price. We spend some time with the girls and went
              home. My mother met me with a rubber hose from the washing machine
              in her hand. She bit me all over my body and the next day I showed
              up at school with a triangle mark on my face and a promise never
              bit anyone. It was an interesting way to explain the thing of no
              violence and beating by violence and beating. My class teacher saw
              a mark and asked what happened to me, I said I fell from the
              stairs. That was good enough to forget about it. Nastya did not
              show up at school for some time and I lost an option to get books
              from the library cause her mother was working there. That case
              made me always find words to resolve anything and I hit a girl in
              the face only once after that. It was more like an unconscious
              reaction than a real intention. I was drunk and my friend’s
              girlfriend got jealous and jumped on me with beating my leg with a
              hill of her boot. I punched her in the face and a security man
              took her away. To be honest at that night I was so tired and angry
              that I was ready to go into the fight and smash her face on the
              floor. Fortunately the security man took the girl away and asked
              me to leave the club. Drinking definitely loosen you and some
              reactions easily slide from the inside. That’s a big danger of
              loosing control and harming someone or yourself.
            </p>
            <p>
              I finished with drinking only in 2011. With my first husband’s
              invitation to raw vegan diet and healthy way of leaving.
