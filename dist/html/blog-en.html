              It was my second trip to India. It was the end of October 2018. We
              landed in Goa and got to the village we were going to live by
              local buses. It took us a while, and I was very tired, when we got
              to Arambol. At first, we rent a pretty expensive room, but

              I landed in Moscow in the middle of March. It was cold and gray. I

              Denis met me with winter coat and shoes at his metro station. He

              I arrived in Goa, India on the 28th of December 2015. The air was
              hot and humid. It felt like I arrived home. It was a totally new
              but familiar feeling. My friend picked me on a scooter from the
              airport. The first thing we’ve done after leaving the airport was

              a month and then rented a room. This was a first move with all my

              When I was working with the holotropic breathing and other

              Most of my life I felt like an alien in a human society. Being 8 I
              remembered living in a different place. My family and I were tall
              big shiny creatures. We communicated telepathically. The
              connection between us and the whole place felt so warm, light and
              happy. I felt loved, accepted, open and relaxed.

              I remember spring of 2003. It was time, when half of my classmates
              including me passed entering exams for the University in
              Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk. Everything was simple and clear. I am going
              into the University with almost all my friends. That was so great.
              We celebrated and started getting ready for the graduation high
              school exams.

              I was born in the middle of Sakhalin Island in a tiny city in
              1986. If you’re imaging Russia with Moscow as a face, Sakhalin
              Island would be a little toe of the right foot near Japan. The
              Island was a prison at a time, so it turned into not
              well-mannered, rough, straightforward society.
