              You might have noticed that I mentioned past life memories before
              which might seem weird. Well, my weirdness started early. When I
              was 5 my father died of cardiac arrest. His body was lying in a
              coffin in the main room. Me, my elder brother and mother were
              sleeping together in the bedroom. I woke up in the middle of the
              night and I saw a boy standing by my side of a bed. He had black
              curly hair and striped white t-shirt. I knew this is my father. I
              looked in the main room, his body was still in the coffin. He
              extended his hand to me and wanted me to give him my hand. I got
              scared. I did not know what to do. So I turned to my mother saying
              that father came. She said to sleep. When I turned back he was
              gone. I have not seen him since.
            </p>
            <p>
              After my father’s death my mother sold the house and moved us into
              an apartment in a five-story apartment building. In this move I
              lost all my toys, because my mother decided I don’t need them
              anymore, and a cat. Our dog got hit by a car not long before my
              father’s death. Our cat used to do his business outside, so he
              started doing it in the apartment building’s corridor. One day he
              disappeared. I was looking for him for quite a while, checking
              every cat looking like him. I have never seen him again. Years
              after I learned that our neighbors took our cat, drove to the
              forest and left him there.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this apartment building I met my first friend Tony. He was
              living right across the corridor. His mother was a tall, nice and
              kind lady. She was always attentive to me. They had a tiny little
              dog named Milo, exactly the same as in a film “The Mask”, which
              was popular at those times, and a turtle, which I saw for the
              first time in my life. Their home felt so warm and welcome.
            </p>
            <p>
              We went to the same special school with Tony. The drawing school
              decided to make a gymnasium class in our city, which meant that
              those kids, who were lucky to get in it, will learn two foreign
              languages, get art, drawing and dance classes extra from a normal
              school programme. So we both got that luck.
            </p>
            <p>
              One winter day after school we went to jump down the hill in the
              snow. At those times winter brought an insane amount of snow and
              -30 to -40 degrees below 0. Every time we jumped we got stuck
              really deep in the snow and could hardly pull each other out. But
              we kept going to the moment when we could not get out. It was
              getting dark and freezing. We were yelling for help, but none of
              passers-by paid any attention. Finally, one girl walking on top of
              a hill saw us, paid attention and helped. We were scared, so she
              decided to entertain us and showed a machine with some cables
              which showed the multiplication of different numbers. I still
              remember her face and her very rare name Agnetta because she was
              so kind and ready to help.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was not very good with numbers at the beginning, so I could not
              understand the multiplication thing and could not memorize it. My
              mother asked her boyfriend to help. After some time trying to pull
              right answers from me, he lost his patience and beat me with a
              leather belt. My conclusion after this was obvious: “Never ask for
              help”. This thing is a tough one. It makes a child feel totally
              alone and lonely. This pushes to realization that he/she has to
              face life on his/her own, which leads to serious tension,
              emotional pain and inability to trust and rely on people. It might
              seem like a good turn for one being responsible for one’s own
              actions, but there is one more element in this which is a feeling
              of weakness and hopefulness because you are still a child and
              depend on caregivers anyways. So you have to face your life on
              your own, but you still have to behave in a way your parents want
              you. So it is like you are between a rock and a hard place because
              you can not choose anything freely. You always have to look around
              if your action goes according to their rules and opinions, no
              matter what you face in your life.
            </p>
            <p>There were some unbreakable rules in my mother’s house:</p>
            <p>
              1. Never come later from the time she said you must be at home
              otherwise you’ll be beaten and grounded for a period of time.
            </p>
            <p>
              I remember one time I went to our upstairs neighbour my mothers
              husband’s sister. We had a great time with her daughter, sitting
              in her room, listening to the music and talking. I noticed that
              I’m getting late, but my mother did not call or come. I thought:
              “Great! I can have some extra nice time here”. But. The door bell
              rang and my mother was standing at their door asking for me to
              come. As soon as the door was closed I got slapped and started to
              fall down the stairs following with slaps and words of abuse and
              anger. At one moment I folded on a railing, thinking may be I can
              get up before the next slap and run down the stairs and out of the
              building but the slap got me earlier than I could do any move. I
              was roughly pushed into the apartment and then finally left along.
            </p>
            <p>
              2. Smile and behave normal, does not matter how you feel and what
              happened.
            </p>
            <p>
              In our special class we celebrated all together birthdays and some
              holidays. This tradition made us a real group and we were hanging
              out all together all the time. One time there was a birthday
              celebration and a class teacher was making riddles and gave
              praises for right answers. Once I said a right answer for a riddle
              but the teacher did not pay attention. I repeated it and she did
              not noticed again. Then the girl next to me repeated my answer and
              was immediately herd and got a praise. My mother saw it and did
              nothing. I left the class, ran into the corridor, and sat on the
              stairs crying. It felt so not fear and I felt weak and lonely. No
              one stood up for me. My mother came to me, saw me crying and
              saying: “this is unfair”. She slapped me in the head saying: “You
              now go back, smile and play with others!” And I did so with a
              feeling of being betrayed and having no one on my side.
            </p>
            <p>3. You do what I say, period.</p>
            <p>
              I was a child who was super curious to know and understand things.
              So I was asking questions all the time. But there was no one ready
              to answer. I think this is partially why teaches never liked me.
              It was unnecessary extra work to answer my questions. I was
              looking for answers everywhere because my mother never really
              spent any time explaining things. Everything must be done the way
              she wants otherwise punishment was coming. I remember one day my
              brother’s friend came to our apartment. And I liked him so much
              that I wanted him to stay forever. So I hid his shoes in a
              wardrobe. When his time to leave came he could not find the shoes.
              My mother figured out that I must be involved in this. I was kind
              of always guilty in any mess in the house. So she asked me and I
              did not answer, I decided to hold on. So as we know her as a
              short-tempered person I got beaten with the leather belt pretty
              fast and showed the shoes in a wardrobe. As we see: do what is
              asked or get beaten. The chose was obvious.
            </p>
            <p>And the last thing</p>
            <p>
              Verbal and physical abuse was normal for my mother and her
              partner. Humiliation and insult were a part of my daily life.
              Mother’s husband played a fine guy till the moment he got his own
              child. My elder brother and I immediately became a burden. I had
              lots of nights talking to my staffed cat, who was definitely my
              best friend and the only one whom I could talk with. I felt like I
              was from an orphanage. At that time I was planing on running away
              from the house. The first variant was to get on the train to
              another city, but the chances to get caught were pretty high, and
              what to do next was not clear. The second variant was to get to
              our garden on a distance from the city and start living there.
              When people come to work there I was planing to hide in the
              forest, but come back to our land at night to eat what was growing
              on the land and sleep in a green house. That plan was pretty
              reasonable, and I could definitely hold on for the summer. But I
              was so scared to be bitten by my mother to death when she will
              find me. So I never made a try. That fear led to a strong feeling
              of hopelessness and that there is no way out of this. Verbal abuse
              led to negative self-esteem and zero self-confidence. At the same
              time relying on myself taught me to be really brave. There were
              lots of situations when I faced scary things with a cold head and
              plain face. I’ll tell you one. Once I rescued my two girl
              classmates from being beaten in a dark park by another strong
              girl. I was a great diplomat and made a superb speech on their
              behalf. Ones there was a party and all schools were invited.
              According to the girl’s street rules you were supposed to dance
              and date with the boys from your school only. But I did not agree
              to this rule and when a guy from another school invited me for a
              dance I agreed and had a nice slow dance. After I went to a
              washroom. As soon as I entered the room six girls from that other
              school came into the room as well as those two rescued girls. As
              soon as they saw me surrounded by the girls from another school
              they immediately left. So I was standing with those girls, and we
              started a conversation. At the end of it we came to a conclusion
              that actually it’s pretty cool to have a choice among a big amount
              of boys from any school in the city. There were three of them at
              that time. After that I was surrounded by girls in different times
              and cities, and I was always brave enough to stay and talk or
              fight if this would be needed. But fortunately talking was always
              good enough.
